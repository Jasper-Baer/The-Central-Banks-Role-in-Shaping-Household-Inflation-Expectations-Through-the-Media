a_2003_6 = '''Good afternoon. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to join you at this impressive conference.
You asked me to provide some thoughts about Basel II, particularly its application in the United States. Before doing that, I would like to inform you of our progress in developing the new accord. As most of you know, we are in a very important stage of the process. Over the past six weeks there have been some crucial developments as a result of the discussions among member regulators, a demonstration once again of the Basel Committee's determination to listen to comments and make those modifications necessary to deliver the best accord possible. The proposal for a capital standard based on unexpected losses submitted by the committee for public comment is a good example of this earnestness in seeking an improved final product. Other issues are still being discussed, including securitization, retail credit, and credit risk mitigation.
One should not forget that, on a parallel track, member countries still have to complete their own domestic efforts to translate the accord into national regulation. As you probably know, the comment period for the initial U.S. proposal for Basel II--known as the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR)--just ended earlier this month. U.S. supervisors are reviewing the comments carefully. If supportable arguments are given for further accord alterations, we will develop proposed changes to present to our colleagues on the committee.
In the United States, after this next round of discussions there will still be additional procedural steps before a final rule is in place, with opportunity for comment at each stage. To be clear, the need for more procedural steps in the United States should not be taken as an indication of our lack of commitment to the Basel process. Rather, it is a sign of our attempt to develop these proposals on as transparent a basis as possible and to hear a wide range of comments. The Congress of the United States has also held hearings on the development of the new accord. The interest and oversight by our Congress in these discussions is appropriate and welcome, particularly for an undertaking as extensive as Basel II. The U.S. regulators appreciate the fact that we are able to operate as independent agencies but also realize that we have an obligation to keep the elected representatives informed of our progress in this major effort. Of course, it is expected that other countries and the European Union will be following their own procedures as well.
Overall, I have been impressed by the efficacy of the comment process and believe it offers an open forum for all parties to voice their opinions. Debate and discussion on such an important undertaking are essential, and--if solid and convincing arguments are put forth--provide a real opportunity for enhancements to the final product. The current proposal is better because the comments have elicited good ideas that have been taken seriously. Future comments based on sound thought and evidence will create further modifications. But I must say that simple assertions will not carry very much weight.
At the same time, we do need to ensure that momentum is maintained. In October, the committee members committed to work promptly to resolve outstanding issues by mid-2004. In January, the Basel Committee will meet to address further analysis of outstanding issues and review the timetable for completing and implementing the committee's work on the accord. Using the agreement reached in the committee as a template, U.S. supervisors then plan to conduct another Quantitative Impact Study (QIS) to gauge more clearly the impact of the Basel proposals. We believe it is critical that we carefully test the new proposal to determine its effects on individual institutions and to ascertain the need to fine-tune the proposal further, a process that could include recalibrating some of the risk-weight functions. It is our sense that other countries will be doing the same. Because timing is a function of the degree of changes required by the QIS, the U.S. agencies will then conduct a full notice of proposed rulemaking once again to seek and then evaluate public comments before adopting a final rule.
U.S. proposals for Basel II
Against that background, let me turn to a number of topics that some have raised about Basel II.
The U.S. banking agencies have, as you know, proposed to implement Basel II somewhat differently than other nations have. These differences are perfectly consistent with the spirit and letter of the proposal, and reflect the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system and the rules and regulations under which it operates. While our approach is best for the United States, it is not necessarily best for other nations.
The U.S. banking agencies propose that only the most advanced approaches under Basel II be offered for banking organizations in the United States: the advanced internal ratings-based approach for credit risk, known as A-IRB, and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk, known as AMA. As indicated in the ANPR, the standardized approach and the foundation IRB approach to Basel II would not be permitted for credit risk. Nor would the basic indicator approach or standardized approach be available for operational risk. The banking agencies took considerable time to develop the advanced proposals, which we believed would clearly be the best option for the U.S. banking system. The complex operations of the largest banks have outgrown the existing capital regime, and for them Basel I has become less and less effective. Indeed, in the view of U.S. supervisors, an overhaul of the regulatory capital system for our largest banks would be worthwhile only if the most advanced approaches were used.
Because of the heterogeneous nature of the U.S. banking system, some balance in the application of Basel II would be necessary. On the one hand, the size, scale and complexity of the internationally active U.S. banks requires, in the opinion of the U.S. supervisors, that these entities operate with the best feasible risk measurement and management procedures, and these procedures are most consistent with the advanced versions of Basel II. On the other hand, the U.S. agencies do not want to impose the higher costs of the advanced version of Basel II on institutions for which it is clearly not suited. In the end, the U.S. banking agencies tried to allow as much choice as possible, while ensuring that banks are still meeting domestic regulatory obligations, avoiding private-sector costs that do not produce some clear and convincing level of benefits, abiding by the evolving Basel II agreement, and, most important, maintaining a safe and sound U.S. banking system.
The U.S. banks that would be required to adopt Basel II, as well as those that we expect to choose or opt in to the new regulatory capital rules, are those that, because of size and complexity, should operate with the most sophisticated risk-management practices. The ANPR lays out objective criteria, including asset size and foreign exposure, to identify the large, internationally active banks that would be considered mandatory banks. Naturally, there are also thousands of banks in the United States that do not qualify as large and internationally active and for which the advanced approach of Basel II may not necessarily be appropriate. The overwhelming majority of these banks are significantly less complex and have a scale of operations and market that generally does not extend beyond the United States. As I will discuss, these entities need not be covered by the revised accord to meet international obligations or our own regulatory responsibilities. Thus, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed that those banks not operating under Basel II advanced approaches would remain under the current U.S. regulatory capital rules.
An important factor in our decision to retain the current capital regime for those entities that are neither large nor significant global competitors is the scale and nature of the existing capital regime in the United States. The U.S. supervisory regime already contains the substantial elements of Pillar Two under Basel II, including evaluations of internal capital adequacy processes. U.S. supervisors have for many years conducted extensive and thorough on-site supervisory reviews, a process which we believe has contributed to a sound banking and financial system. In addition, the culture of disclosure within the United States already comes close to, and in some areas exceeds, the Pillar Three requirements of the accord revisions. For those U.S. institutions with public debt or equity, requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as demands by the market, translate into fairly extensive public disclosure.
Moreover, these small and medium-sized banks for the most part already hold capital well in excess of the supervisory minima under both the current and proposed capital regimes. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of U.S. banks maintain capital above the well-capitalized criteria of 10 percent of risk-weighted assets under the U.S. prompt corrective action rules, and generally the smaller the bank, the larger the proportionate capital cushion. Nearly 95 percent of all small and medium-sized banks have regulatory capital ratios of at least 10 percent, and thus it is likely that their current ratios would essentially meet or surpass proposed requirements under Basel II. Therefore, we believe that the current approach to determining regulatory minimum capital in the United States is at least as prudent as Basel II.
While U.S. supervisors see no need to require Basel II for banks not considered large or internationally active, the proposal would allow any bank to adopt the accord revisions if it so desired. Of course, any bank wishing to adopt Basel II would have to meet the same high standards applied to mandatory institutions, particularly the internal measurement and management of risk for its exposures. For some large nonmandatory regional institutions, moving to Basel II may be a good choice, and we anticipate that at least ten, and perhaps more, may do so. In effect, the approach proposed in the United States requires that those institutions that would not be required by scale or global activities to adopt the A-IRB version of Basel II would have to conduct their own cost-benefit analysis to determine if they should opt in or wait, perhaps for the costs of implementation to come down through vendor and other developments, or, alternatively, if they should remain under the current capital regime. Initially, some of our colleagues on the Basel Supervisors' Committee criticized the U.S. agencies' approach to scope of application, claiming that the application was too limited or inconsistent with the proposed accord. But this criticism has faded with better understanding of the structure of the U.S. banking system: More than two-thirds of the assets of U.S. banking organizations are likely to be covered by Basel II, as well as more than 99 percent of the foreign claims held by U.S. banking organizations.
Potential Competitive Effects
The U.S. agencies have increasingly focused on the potential competitive effects of Basel II on U.S. banks. As the ANPR outlines, policymakers will be attentive to the competitive concerns of both the institutions expected to adopt Basel II in the United States, and those that might not. We are of course interested in the evidence developed from the ANPR. In addition, Fed staff members are now conducting empirical research to try to determine if the bifurcated approach has any implications for possible acquisition strategies to be used by advanced Basel II banks in acquiring non-Basel II banks. Moreover, we are also trying to determine empirically the evidence for the competitive implications of the U.S. implementation proposals on credit for small and medium-sized business, residential mortgage, and credit card markets. If that empirical evidence indicates a high probability of general competitive imbalances, we will then review our options for addressing the problem. But we first need to see the evidence that a problem exists and then determine how large it may be. That these issues surfaced, I might add, illustrates the benefits of a transparent comment period.
Standards for Basel II
One would hope that, by now, no one misunderstands the extensive requirements for any institution adopting Basel II, particularly for the advanced approaches that will be the only option in the United States. Because capital requirements under the advanced approaches will be based on bank inputs, the bar will clearly have to be raised, particularly for risk management and control systems. For most banks--in fact, I would say for all banks moving to the advanced versions of Basel II--meeting these standards and requirements will be very challenging and will require substantial resources. Managers at some institutions may believe that their institution is already very close to meeting all the prerequisites for Basel II. Although our rules and standards are not yet final, on the basis of pilot reviews and discussions with line supervisors here in the United States, I would advise any institution thinking it has little work remaining to make a careful and frank reassessment of where it stands.
In the United States we are developing a set of supervisory guidance to accompany our rulemaking. This supervisory guidance, which will be developed for all A-IRB credit portfolios of Basel II as well as for the AMA, is intended to provide additional clarity and interpretation of the rule, and to more clearly define supervisory expectations. And the guidance, by describing in more detail what it will take to satisfy U.S. supervisors, should assist nonmandatory banks in deciding whether to opt in. Initial drafts of supervisory guidance for corporate A-IRB and for AMA were published for comment in concert with the ANPR. U.S. regulators are already reviewing feedback on this draft supervisory guidance and, as with the ANPR, remain open to suggestions for altering that guidance if we are presented with valid arguments for doing so. Draft guidance for other A-IRB portfolios, such as retail, is being developed and will be published for comment as well.
This is also a good opportunity for me to add a few initial thoughts about the possible nature of qualifying examinations for Basel II in the United States. As I noted, we still need to reach an agreement in Basel and complete the process for formulating a final rule in the United States before we can start assessing institutions vis-à-vis new standards related to Basel II. However, the U.S. agencies are starting to identify, on a joint basis, what a qualification process for Basel II would encompass, both for mandatory and opt-in banking organizations. This will not be an easy task, in part because our particular regulatory structure has different supervisors overseeing different banks and legal entity types. And it will be complicated by the need to coordinate qualification internationally with host jurisdictions to minimize the burden on banking organizations supervised by agencies from multiple countries.
Cooperation among the U.S. agencies on this and other matters relating to Basel II implementation has been excellent. There is, of course, no expectation that under Basel II the U.S. regulatory structure will change in terms of the legal mandates assigned to each agency. As the ANPR states, an institution's primary federal supervisor would have responsibility for determining an institution's readiness for an advanced approach and ultimately would be responsible, after consultation with other relevant supervisors, for determining whether the institution satisfies the supervisory expectations for the advanced approaches. And this procedure will obviously apply at both the bank and bank holding company level in the United States. Given the significance of Basel II, enhanced communication and cooperation among U.S. supervisory agencies--and between U.S. supervisors and affected host country supervisors--will be necessary. We are already in agreement that the U.S. qualification process will be intensive, rigorous, and lengthy, because of the nature of what we are about to embark upon. But in the end we believe that a rigorous qualification process will create a more risk-sensitive regulatory capital regime and improve risk management.
Cross-border issues
The accord revisions wisely contain a certain amount of flexibility to account for differences in the banking systems of member countries. These so-called national discretion elements, combined with different approaches that member countries might choose for their banking system, mean that maintaining a level playing field across countries is a challenge. Achieving an acceptable level of consistency in implementation is something that the Basel Committee takes seriously and is the reason it formed the Accord Implementation Group (AIG) two years ago. The AIG comprises line supervisors from member countries and is charged with identifying potential implementation issues and creating as much consistency as possible across countries. These issues, which are referred to as "cross border" or "home/host" issues, cover both credit and operational risk. Cross-border issues are particularly complicated because the new accord will apply to both consolidated banking organizations in home countries as well as subsidiary bank and bank holding companies in host countries.
This August the AIG issued a set of high-level principles for cross-border implementation of the accord. These principles lay the groundwork for further cooperation and coordination for implementation among member countries. They clearly identify the need to respect both home and host country rules and regulations, the need for enhanced and pragmatic cooperation between both types of supervisors, and the desire for supervisors to minimize the burden on banking groups as much as possible. The U.S. agencies believe that their choice for scope of application is consistent with these principles. For example, the proposal to allow only the advanced approaches in the United States also extends to any U.S. banking subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations and reflects our legitimate role as host country supervisors and the principles of national treatment. At the same time, we understand that other countries may offer approaches that are different from those offered in the United States. So a consolidated banking organization not based in the United States may choose to operate under an approach not offered in our country--such as foundation IRB for credit risk or basic indicator for operational risk--even though the advanced approaches would be the only ones available to its U.S. bank and bank holding company subsidiaries. And if those U.S. subsidiaries are not considered mandatory Basel II institutions, they also have the option of remaining on the current U.S. regulatory capital regime.
By the same logic, foreign banking subsidiaries of U.S.-based organizations would have to abide by the local rules and regulations of host country supervisors, even if their consolidated entity is operating under different rules. These differences between approaches offered in host versus home countries present challenges for global banking organizations, both foreign-based and U.S.-based. As a result, U.S. supervisors need to work very closely with supervisors from other member countries to assist banking organizations in meeting the various requirements. The AIG has already begun to foster this type of collaboration. For this issue the bottom line is that legal mandates across countries are not going to change, and supervisors realize that they have an added responsibility to keep complexity to a minimum.
One of the most challenging home/host issues that has arisen of late is the allocation of operational risk capital within a consolidated banking organization. This issue, similar to other cross-border issues, goes right to the heart of home/host supervision. The conflict arises because host supervisors may require subsidiary banks at the local level to hold a certain amount of capital which, when aggregated across both geography and entity type, may be greater than what the consolidated organization deems necessary, because of diversification effects. This is clearly a difficult issue. As Chairman Caruana commented last month, it may well take some time for our efforts to converge to an acceptable solution in this matter, and that solution may not be completely satisfactory for all parties. Right now the AIG is working with the Committee's Risk Management Group (RMG) to develop a set of possible solutions to the problem. My expectation is that reaching a solution will require a slow and steady effort, but in the end, we will reach an acceptable compromise. In that sense, this issue reflects much of what the Basel II process is all about--identifying challenging issues, listening carefully to comments, conducting analysis to find a range of possible options, and then reaching an acceptable compromise solution that is consistent with safety and soundness.
Finally, I would like to turn to the AIG's work on consistency of standards. Because member countries have different supervisory regimes, there is the possibility for Basel II rules to be applied in a variety of ways. While some variety in standards across countries may be unavoidable, we believe that maintaining as much consistency as possible is a worthwhile objective. It benefits no one if there is an appearance that countries vary considerably in their application of standards. The entire accord is undermined if a set of banks from one country appears to be subject to softer standards. We are already happy with the progress we have seen within the AIG on this issue and believe that pursuing the goal of consistent standards will truly bring about a better and safer global banking system.
Concluding Thoughts
I thank you for the opportunity to share some of my thoughts on Basel II. As I stated, I consider the recent decisions reached by the Basel Committee to be a very good example of how supportable and valid arguments for alterations in the accord proposals are taken seriously. In the United States, additional opportunities still remain for comments to be heard and for possible modifications as the United States continues its rulemaking processes. That said, we do not expect to slacken the high standards expected of banks operating under the advanced approaches for Basel II.
The U.S. agencies have tailored the application of Basel II to the particular characteristics of the U.S. banking system, while maintaining both the letter and spirit of the accord. We expect other countries to act similarly with regard to their own banking systems. We understand that a number of cross-border issues relating to Basel II implementation pose challenges, and that it may take some time to resolve them. This will of course mean that supervisors across countries must work even more closely together. But I hope it is evident that the fervent efforts among member countries to heed comments and to find solutions underscore our commitment to craft the best accord revisions possible, while maintaining a safe and sound global banking system.'''

a_2003_42 ='''Thank you for the invitation to be with you today. I would like to focus my remarks largely on what I think will, over time, lead the U.S. economy back to a path of solid economic expansion. In particular, I want to explain to you why I believe that, although the economy still faces substantial risks and although the timing and the extent of a pickup in activity remain uncertain, the stage has been set for an improvement in the economic climate. To lay the groundwork for that discussion and to put the current situation into perspective, I will briefly step back and touch on some recent economic history. I should note that my comments today reflect my own opinions and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or the Federal Open Market Committee.
As you know, the latter half of the 1990s was a time of remarkable economic performance. Businesses added workers and expanded output at a rapid clip. The unemployment rate fell from over 7-1/2 percent in the middle of 1992 to just under 4 percent by the end of 2000. In Minnesota, the unemployment rate fell from 5.2 percent to 3.4 percent over the same period. The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated. Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity. To be sure, some of the acceleration in productivity over that period was cyclical in nature; but more critical for our longer-run economic performance is that at least a portion of the pickup now appears sustainable.
By late 2000, the boom had come to an end. The stock market began to retreat in early 2000, and by the end of the year, analysts were revising down their expectations for future earnings. Many businesses were cutting back sharply on capital investment--particularly in high-tech equipment--as demand and profits weakened and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications industry, found that they had overspent on equipment during the boom.
The downturn in the economy, which began in 2000, had two distinct characteristics. First, and thankfully, it turned out to be one of the shallowest in our economic history. Second, it was one of the few business-led recessions in the United States since the end of the Second World War. Most recessions since then have been brought on by sharp cutbacks in spending by households, with housing and consumer durables among the most sensitive sectors.
The recent experience was clearly different. Consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained throughout 2001, even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth. Despite only modest increases in nominal wages and salaries, households' real disposable income was supported by tax cuts and lower inflation. In addition, low interest rates helped promote spending. As you know, consumers took advantage of falling mortgage rates to buy new homes, to refinance their existing mortgage debt, and to tap into their increasing home equity to pay off more expensive debt or to finance spending on other things. As a result, the contraction in real GDP during the first three quarters of 2001 turned out to be quite shallow despite the disruptive economic fallout from the horrific events of September 11.
By early last summer, economic recovery appeared to be under way. Real GDP increased at an annual rate of roughly 3-1/2 percent over the first three quarters of the year. Businesses seemed to have brought their inventories into better alignment with sales, and employment began to rise again, though the gains were too small to make a dent in the unemployment rate. A particularly encouraging development, given the nature of the downturn, was that the contraction in business investment appeared to be slowing while household spending, still supported by low interest rates and gains in real disposable income, continued to trend up.
Although the government statistics were looking a bit better, signs appeared over the summer that the economy's resilience would be tested by several new shocks. As a banker who experienced several previous economic downturns, I know that whatever weaknesses exist in our economy become problematic at the low point of the economic cycle. At such times, we typically see loan losses and evidence of weak business models. What emerged in early 2002 was not what I had expected. The Enron and WorldCom scandals raised serious concerns about the adequacy of the corporate governance system and tended to cloud the outlook for business expansion. Abroad, mounting tensions with Iraq were beginning to take their toll on consumer and business confidence. The stock market moved down again, conditions eroded in corporate debt markets, and risk spreads widened. As we moved into the fall, industrial production faltered, and business investment posted only modest and uneven gains. By the final quarter of 2002, real GDP growth had slowed to a pace of 1-1/2 percent, and heightened caution in the business sector showed through to renewed layoffs and a sharp cutback in inventory investment.
That brief review brings us to this year, which began with a few bright spots: Concerns about corporate governance were apparently receding, employment and industrial production moved up solidly in January, and the unemployment rate edged down a bit. Unfortunately, these improvements were short-lived. In late February and early March, as the confrontation with Iraq heated up, uncertainty was pervasive. No one knew if or when the war would start, or end. The possibilities that chemical or biological weapons might be used, that the war might spread, or that terrorists might again attack on U.S. soil seemed to be quite real. There was a risk that Iraq's oil fields might be damaged. The ranges of possible outcomes and of their economic consequences were extremely wide.
The uncertainty hit consumer confidence hard. The University of Michigan's survey of consumer attitudes reported that, by the middle of March, confidence had fallen to its lowest level since the early 1990s and was below what we would have expected given the state of the economy. The oil, equity, and financial markets all showed signs of strain. Oil prices rose to nearly $40 per barrel in early March, though civil strife in Venezuela undoubtedly played a role in the increase. Broad stock market indexes moved down about 10 percent in the two months leading up to the war, and the equity risk premium widened. Measures of implied volatility in stocks edged up. All in all, the economy's performance in the first quarter of 2003 ended up little better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2002. Real GDP again rose at an annual rate of about 1-1/2 percent as both households and businesses reined in spending. Our overall economic performance would have been even weaker had housing markets not remained vibrant.
Fortunately, the range of plausible outcomes narrowed significantly even before the official conclusion of hostilities with Iraq. As the onset of the war became imminent, financial markets rallied. Oil prices fell sharply during the week that ended with coalition missile attacks on Baghdad.
Two months have passed since the war began, and we do not yet have a clear understanding of how strongly the economy is emerging from this most recent shock. The most positive signs are responses from energy and equity markets. The price of crude oil has returned to levels that prevailed at the end of last year, and both households and businesses should welcome the lower energy bills. Equity values, with additional support from generally favorable earnings reports, are up substantially. Spreads have narrowed significantly, continuing the downward trend that began last fall. Other positive signs include further reductions in mortgage interest rates and the rebound in consumer confidence. All told, these indicators point to a noticeable reduction in the economic tensions that built up earlier this year.
Though markets can respond instantly to positive news, business investment decisions adjust more slowly, and that distinction is evident in current production and employment data. Businesses cut another 80,000 jobs in April, the jobless rate moved up to 6 percent, and new claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks remain at levels associated with little net change in jobs. (In Minnesota, the jobless rate moved up to 4.4 percent in March, and about 28,000 workers filed claims for unemployment compensation in April.) Industrial production fell 1/2 percent in both March and April, and capacity utilization is under 75 percent. Retail sales have been, on balance, lackluster in recent months.
Turning briefly to inflation, last week's report on the consumer price index showed, as expected, that consumer energy prices had begun to retreat noticeably last month, reversing about one-third of the run-up over the first three months of the year. In April, prices of core goods and services--that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy--were unchanged for a second month. As a result, the core CPI was up just 1-1/2 percent from last April.
On balance, these indicators suggest that the economy will probably remain soft in the near future and that inflation will remain low. Nonetheless, I continue to believe that the pieces are in place for future robust growth.
Looking back over the past three years, I am struck by how much the U.S. economy has had to contend with. For much of the period since mid-2001, large negative wealth effects from the falling stock market, the shakeout in the high-tech sector, and the slowdown in economic activity abroad have combined to restrain economic activity. Outside shocks, such as September 11, corporate scandals, and the war with Iraq, provided additional drag to renewed expansion. The economy, however, proved to be remarkably resilient.
Looking forward, one must ask, what will lead to economic growth? The best way to start answering that question is to look at the fundamental forces shaping economic activity. In that regard, a first consideration is that financial conditions should prove conducive to stronger economic growth over the next year or so. Monetary policy is very accommodative. The nominal federal funds rate is currently 1-1/4 percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is at or below zero, as compared with the real rate's long-run average of about 2-3/4 percent. With corporate risk spreads having narrowed considerably, borrowing terms are now quite favorable. Business financing needs have been very limited recently, and demand for credit has been weak. But the financial sector is well capitalized and under little stress, and lenders should be well positioned to fund a pickup in business demand for credit. In addition, as I noted earlier, equity prices have moved up again.
Fiscal policy, like monetary policy, has been providing fundamental stimulus to economic growth over the past two years, through both tax cuts and higher outlays for defense. The tax proposals currently under consideration by the Congress could add to that stimulus, either by accelerating some of the tax cuts enacted previously or by excluding some portion of dividends from taxable income.
A third factor underpinning longer-run prospects for growth is the sustained strong uptrend in labor productivity. Labor productivity rose 2 percent in 2001, a remarkable showing for a recession year, and it was up an additional 4 percent in 2002. Productivity appears to have a strong underlying trend, which could support overall income growth even if the weakness in the labor market continues for a while longer.
In assessing how these factors will play out over time, I find it useful to consider separately how they translate into a pickup in demand among households and among businesses. From the perspective of households, the combination of lower energy prices and tax cuts should help bolster real disposable income in the near term. In addition, the drag on household spending from the earlier declines in stock market wealth should gradually diminish, especially if the stock market holds on to its recent gains. Low interest rates should allow consumers to continue to finance their purchases relatively cheaply, whether through home equity loans or through more standard instruments.
The outlook for the business sector is perhaps a more critical consideration. Here, too, the fundamentals look favorable. In the near term, lower oil prices should reduce the costs of production for many businesses and free funds for other uses. Also, with interest rates low, the incentives for capital expenditure in the tax code in place until late 2004, and prices for high-tech goods still falling, the cost of capital should remain low. Over the longer run, the continuing rapid pace of technological innovation implies that there are many potential investments that offer attractive returns. In the uncertain business environment that has prevailed for some time, many businesses have probably been making do with their existing equipment, stretching out their normal replacement cycles, especially for rapidly depreciating high-tech equipment. Overall, though shifts in business attitudes are difficult to measure, I believe that markets reward businesses that outperform their competitors and that, as demand picks up, companies will respond to opportunities to incorporate technological advances in production, communication, and organization. Because of the uncertainties that have been restraining investment, predicting exactly when firms will act is difficult; but I do believe that they will act.
As you can see, I remain generally optimistic about the longer-run prospects for the U.S. economy. However, I want to mention some significant questions about the outlook. Perhaps the most significant is whether the slump in capital spending will be more prolonged than expected. Such a slump could occur if firms remain so uncertain about the outlook for a pickup in sales that they continue to shelve plans for upgrading or expanding their businesses. Given the very low levels of capacity utilization both in our factories and in service-providing industries such as telecom and air transportation and the high vacancy rates in many office buildings, this risk is not trivial. For example, here in the Twin Cities metro area, one-fifth of available office space sat empty at the end of last year.
Another question that is frequently asked is whether financial stress in the household sector might restrain growth. Specifically, some argue that the high level of consumer debt might mean that households will be unable to increase spending substantially for some time to come. To be sure, the debt service burden is quite high by historical standards, and personal bankruptcies moved up in 2001 and 2002. However, households have been converting their more expensive, non-tax-deductible debt into mortgage debt, which has helped keep the debt service burden fairly stable during the past few years. What is more, banks are not experiencing broad weakness in their consumer loan portfolios as most of the increase in delinquencies has been in a narrow spectrum of households. On the whole, looking at the available evidence, I tend to give less weight to the questions concerning the financial situation of households than I do to the risks of continued uncertainty in the business sector.
A third question bearing on the outlook for the U.S. economy regards prospects for a pickup in activity among our major trading partners. Concerns about the strength of the global economy remain, and the emergence of SARS poses a threat to the economic prospects of several emerging-market economies in Asia. To date, however, we have no evidence that the new disease has affected U.S. economic activity. Nonetheless, continued slow growth abroad could have a damping effect on our recovery here.
To summarize, the recent news from oil and financial markets and about consumer confidence clearly suggests that the reduction in risks associated with the situation in Iraq has had a number of favorable effects. At the same time, the available indicators of production and employment suggest that the pace of economic activity may remain slow for a while longer, likely restrained by lingering uncertainty about the timing of economic recovery. Looking ahead, however, it seems likely that, at some point the combined effects of a fundamentally solid financial sector, sustained consumer spending power, and improving consumer confidence will demonstrate sufficient demand potential to stimulate increased levels of capital investment.'''

a_2002_9 = '''It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you today. Certainly, the theme for today's session--"North American Monetary Policy"--ought to provoke some lively discussion. Let me start with the usual disclaimer--my remarks reflect my personal views and should not be taken as an official view of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve System. As you know, the FOMC last week chose to lower the target federal funds rate 50 basis points to a forty-year low of 1-1/4 percent and also indicated that it viewed the risks to the economy going forward as balanced. Of course, the macroeconomic developments over the last few years that have brought us to this point have been quite remarkable, and I'll offer some perspectives on some of those key developments in a moment. Over this same period, there have been some quite important developments in the art and science of central banking, and it seems useful to pause here at the outset to take stock of this evolution in central banking practice in the United States.
Though barely a single page in length, last week's FOMC announcement embodied all of the key structural elements of the current monetary policy framework in the United States. The text of the announcement provided a rationale for the decision in terms of the FOMC's twin objectives--long-run price stability and sustainable economic growth. The policy decision itself involved a specific setting for the key monetary policy instrument--the target federal funds rate. And the goals of central bank transparency and accountability were served by a discussion of the Committee's views about the important forces impinging on the economy at the present time and its sense of the balance of risks to the economy in the future. All three of these key elements of the monetary policy framework--the FOMC's objectives, primary policy instrument, and emphasis on transparency--have undergone significant change in recent years.
As indicated in the original version of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, the Federal Reserve was founded "to furnish an elastic currency" and to promote "more effective supervision of banking." It wasn't until 1977 that the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to include very specific monetary policy objectives. Notably, the Congress established a so-called dual mandate for the Federal Reserve by directing it to foster conditions that would promote the goals of price stability and "maximum" employment. Over time, maximum employment is only possible when economic growth is sustainable--that is, when economic growth is sufficient to eventually eliminate any gap between level of aggregate demand and the economy's potential to produce. These dual objectives of price stability and sustainable output growth are the cornerstones of the U.S. monetary policy framework. The U.S. system of dual monetary policy objectives is sometimes regarded as quite distinct from the monetary policy frameworks adopted by many other countries in recent years that tend to emphasize price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy. My own view, though, is that the apparent differences between such frameworks and the U.S. system--while significant--may not be quite so large as commonly believed. For example, in addition to a price stability objective, many central bank charters include references to auxiliary objectives such as supporting the nation's general economic welfare or the stability of the financial system.
The instruments of monetary policy have changed in significant ways as well. In the United States and some other countries, money and credit aggregates have played an especially important role as monetary policy instruments at times in the past. However, the use of such variables as reliable guides for policy became increasingly problematic over recent years as increased competition and innovation in the financial sector tended to undermine the historical linkages between money and credit aggregates and key macroeconomic variables such as nominal GDP. Partly as a result, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, came to view setting a particular level for a short-term interest rate, rather than controlling the growth of money and credit aggregates, as the primary modus operandi of monetary policy.
A final trend in central banking that was again implicit in last week's FOMC announcement is a movement toward greater transparency. Less than a decade ago, for example, the FOMC did not explicitly announce its policy decisions. Indeed, through much of the 1980s and early 1990s, the FOMC "signaled" its policy intentions to the market indirectly through a process involving technical distinctions among particular types of open market operations. In retrospect, while this procedure helped to support a cottage industry of Wall Street Fedwatchers, it increasingly came to be seen by the public and the Federal Reserve as unnecessary and even counterproductive. As a result, in 1994, the FOMC began explicitly announcing its policy decisions.
In a bid to further increase transparency, the FOMC introduced a balance of risks assessment in early 2000 as part of its policy decisions. The balance of risks assessment was designed as a vehicle to communicate the Committee's sense of the economic outlook over the "foreseeable future." The foreseeable future is one of those wonderful phrases we central bankers get to use. It is not intended to refer to a specific time horizon, and indeed, when the FOMC introduced the balance of risks statement, it suggested that the time horizon encompassed by the foreseeable future might well vary depending on the economic circumstances. However, in contrast to the previous "bias" statement, the concept of the foreseeable future in the balance of risks statement was intended to extend well beyond the upcoming intermeeting period. The balance of risks statement is released to the public at the conclusion of each FOMC meeting. By contrast, prior to 1999, the "bias" statement was only made known to the public after a six-week lag in the release of the minutes for each FOMC meeting. This past March, the FOMC took a further step toward increased transparency by including the roll call of the vote on the federal funds rate target, as well as an indication of the preferred policy choice of any dissenters. Indeed, press coverage following the September FOMC meeting noted the two dissents in favor of a policy easing reported in the announcement following that meeting.
So why have the Federal Reserve and many other central banks moved toward a policy framework involving greater transparency? The principle that central banks should be free of political interference in pursuing legally mandated objectives is now widely regarded as a key tenet supporting central bank credibility and effectiveness. However, democratic societies rightly should expect that central banks, as public institutions, should be publicly accountable for their actions, and greater transparency in central banking is an important factor in ensuring that this is the case. But central banks have found transparency useful for monetary policy purposes as well. By providing a clear rationale for their actions and an assessment of the economic outlook, central banks can reduce unnecessary uncertainties faced by market participants. Moreover, investors armed with a clearer understanding of the central bank's motives and views are better able to anticipate future monetary policy actions. This, in turn, helps to create a form of "automatic stabilizer" operating in financial markets; as the economy is buffeted by shocks, market participants anticipate how the central bank is likely to move short-term interest rates in the future, and these expectations are then immediately reflected in movements in long-term interest rates that help to counteract the effects of the shocks.
Well, I hope by now I've convinced you that the FOMC's announcements--though sometimes criticized as terse or inscrutable--are in fact the embodiment of nearly every major change in the U.S. monetary policy framework in the last twenty-five years. Not bad for a one-page document. Having talked at some length about the broad conceptual framework underlying last week's FOMC announcement, I'd like to now turn to what it actually said. A key passage of the announcement read as follows:
The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. However, incoming economic data have tended to confirm that greater uncertainty, in part attributable to heightened geopolitical risks, is currently inhibiting spending, production, and employment.
Those two sentences succinctly summarize the important crosscurrents that the FOMC must take into account in the current environment. On the one hand, the current very low setting of the target funds rate is undoubtedly imparting considerable economic stimulus. Moreover, the U.S. economy has proven to be remarkably resilient in recent years, and underlying economic trends such as continued strong productivity growth bode well for economic prospects in the longer run. Indeed, the latest productivity data released just last week showed yet another very substantial increase in labor productivity in the third quarter. While some of the recent outsized increases in productivity may prove to be temporary, the recent data do suggest that underlying trend productivity growth remains quite buoyant, and that, in turn, should ultimately show through to stronger incomes for households and an improved profit outlook for businesses.
On the other hand, the U.S. economy has been beset by a string of adverse shocks in the last two years, and the FOMC last week expressed its concerns that the lingering effects of those shocks and the uncertainty about the economic outlook were factors hindering the economic recovery. As noted in the minutes of several past FOMC meetings, that uncertainty seems to be attributable to a confluence of several factors. The high-profile cases of corporate accounting scandals in the United States over recent months undoubtedly are an important part of the story. Certainly, the direct costs of these episodes in terms of losses sustained by investors and employees in the affected firms have been very substantial. But even more pernicious from a macroeconomic perspective has been the ensuing widespread loss of investor confidence in the integrity of firms' financial statements more broadly. Unfortunately, the spectacular misdeeds that have come to light have made it perfectly rational for investors to question the veracity of data and other information disclosed by all businesses. And that mistrust, in turn, has almost certainly contributed to the downdraft in many firms' equity prices and an increase in borrowing costs over recent months.
A related key source of uncertainty in the economic outlook is the prospect for a rebound in investment spending. To date, the Federal Reserve's easing actions have spurred the economy most visibly by increasing consumer demand for interest-sensitive items--particularly autos and new homes. Businesses, by contrast, have largely acted to shore up their frayed balance sheets by locking in longer-term funding at attractive rates and using the proceeds to pay down other forms of debt or to stockpile substantial holdings of liquid assets. To be sure, although it has yet to show any real signs of vigor, business fixed investment has at least seemed to stabilize. And business inventories currently seem lean in many industries, so there may be considerable scope for a pickup in inventory investment as the economy recovers. Still, for now, the pace of investment spending is tepid at best.
Finally, of course, the world situation is yet another factor contributing to the overall uncertainty about near-term economic prospects. The potential for further terrorist attacks and the tense situation in the Mideast are obviously sources of concern. Moreover, Europe seems to be encountering a "soft spot" in economic activity similar to that evident in recent weeks in the United States. And, of course, the economic difficulties in Japan and South America are well known and seem unlikely to abate significantly over the near term.
Despite the significant uncertainties, the FOMC retained an overall sense of confidence about prospects for the U.S. economy. Indeed, the FOMC statement also included the passage:
[T]he Committee believes that today's additional monetary easing should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot. With this action, the Committee believes that…the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals [sustainable economic growth and price stability] in the foreseeable future.
Thus, barring further adverse shocks, the FOMC perceived the economy as passing through a "soft spot" at present and viewed the current stance of policy as adequate to foster the economic recovery. Let me assure you, though, that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and stands ready, as always, to implement any changes in the stance of policy deemed necessary to ensure progress toward achieving its twin goals of sustainable economic growth and price stability.'''

a_2002_10 = '''Many of us began our careers in the financial services industry during an era when bank and thrift executives saw each other as both business competitors and political foes. I distinctly remember one experience I had as a member of the American Bankers Association's Government Relations Committee in 1979. At our first meeting of the year, the "quarter-point differential" that thrift institutions were allowed under Regulation Q was the banking industry's top political priority. For those of you too young to remember, Regulation Q established the maximum allowable interest rate that could be paid on deposit accounts, which at the time was a quarter point higher for thrifts. This first annual meeting of the Ohio Bankers League following the merger of Ohio's banking and thrift trade associations is emblematic of the changes that have taken place in these two industries. And this event presents a good opportunity to review today's depository financial service industries in the context of a decade of major change. To begin, let's review the highlights of the past decade.
First, there was the bank and thrift crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many banks and thrifts failed, and many others were weakened to the point that they became acquisition targets. The Congress and the regulators responded forcefully with the Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) in 1989, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) in 1991. These legislative initiatives restricted banking practices, limited the supervisors' discretion in dealing with weak banks, imposed new regulatory requirements--including prompt corrective action--and strengthened supervisory oversight overall.
Beyond the bank and thrift crisis in this country, there were also indications that banks of other nations followed different norms of capital adequacy, which had implications for competitive equity and for the overall soundness of the global banking system. The G-10 nations responded with the Basel Accord, a single, fairly simple global standard that was implemented in the early 1990s. The Basel standards have become somewhat less simple over the years and are again under review. But achieving international agreement on both components of capital and a risk-based approach to capital adequacy was a major achievement.
A second force for change was the growing integration of banking markets, both geographically and functionally. Through the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, the various states were liberalizing or eliminating their restrictions on interstate bank ownership. At the same time, nonbanks aggressively developed and offered products that could compete directly with banking products.
The Reigle-Neal Act of 1994 was the epilogue to the saga of interstate banking, eliminating the remaining barriers to interstate ownership and interstate branching. As a result, in an era of consolidation and innovation, banks could pursue merger partners and branching strategies on the basis of economics rather than geography while also consolidating and rationalizing their own legal structure.
The boundaries between banking products and other financial service offerings have also become less clear. Over the past decade, banks were increasingly interested in providing the full range of products and services available from their nonbank competitors, to create operating efficiencies, diversify potential revenue sources, and allow these banks to compete effectively with other [nonbank] full-service financial services firms. The bank holding company structure was one vehicle for doing so, especially securities underwriting and dealing through section 20 subsidiaries. Although revenues from bank-ineligible securities activities were initially limited to 5 percent of a BHC's income, the Board subsequently increased that limit to 25 percent. At this higher level, we began to see significant merger activity between securities firms and bank holding companies.
In 1999, the Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, arguably the most significant banking legislation in the last quarter of the twentieth century. It dismantled much of the Glass-Steagall Act, which for more than fifty years separated the banking and securities industries.
The most significant changes, however, did not occur in the Congress. Indeed, they occurred in the marketplace. We experienced unprecedented change, from innovation in market practice to new technologies that created new products and financial vehicles. In the process, we also spawned a new generation of more sophisticated and rigorous risk-management practices. The expansion of securitization and derivative markets allowed for management and transfer of risk, which in turn created opportunities for banks to specialize increasingly in those phases of the financial-intermediation process in which they have an advantage, while also offering new hedging and risk-management opportunities.
Finally, it is important not to overlook a fourth force for change, a decade of economic prosperity that provided a rich context for growth and opportunity in the banking industry, and for financial markets more generally. This prosperity was fueled significantly by capital investment in information technology and in telecommunications capabilities. Ongoing advances in technology, related in part to this investment, further supported the level of economic activity. The resulting structural improvements in productivity allowed for significant growth both in output and in compensation to workers, who in turn could acquire consumer goods and make financial investments in debt and equity markets.
Given the magnitude of the changes over the past decade, how does the reality of the current industry status compare with our expectations of ten years ago? Let's start with the thrifts. Many, if not most observers expected the thrift industry to struggle, perhaps never fully recovering from the problems of the 1980s and early 1990s. Indeed, the future of any financial institution that specialized in originating and holding residential mortgages seemed somewhat murky. By the same token, many anticipated that the banking industry would be reined in by heavy regulation, the new regulatory capital standards, and--perhaps--significant aversion to bold new initiatives. And many expected that gradual movement toward broader interstate banking would bring about massive consolidation in the banking industry that would raise serious questions about the future of community banks and the value of the community banking franchise more generally. Broader interstate banking also raised questions about the viability of the dual banking system, and the state banking charter in particular. Technological improvements were expected to dramatically reduce the use of checks and cash. Bricks and mortar branches were thought to be anachronistic, if not actual impediments, to operational efficiency. Well, as you all know, forecasting is a difficult business.
In the thrift industry, there has certainly been consolidation. There are now significantly fewer, but bigger, thrifts. As of June, there were just under 1,000 thrifts, with total assets of $960 billion compared with 1,952 thrifts with assets of $839 billion in 1992. The average thrift now has assets of about $960 million--more than twice the average of $430 million in 1992--and has an annual growth rate of more than 9 percent. Over this period many thrifts merged with each other while many others became part of bank holding companies, some of these operating as thrifts. Some of those were Ohio thrifts that were acquired by major banks in the late 1980s in the wake of the state deposit insurance crisis.
Today, the thrift industry continues to be strong and viable. In 2001, the industry generated $10 billion in earnings, or a return on assets of about 1.09 percent--both about five times the comparable figures for 1992. The extent to which the banking and thrift industries are intertwined may be best reflected by the fact that 34 percent of savings institution deposits are now BIF-insured.
The banking industry too has experienced consolidation, as the number of insured commercial banks declined from about 11,450 in 1992 (with total assets of $3.5 trillion) to about 7,960 in June of this year (with total assets of $6.7 trillion). Interestingly, the average bank then, as now, was about $120 million smaller than the average thrift: $310 million in 1992 compared with $840 million as of this June. Banks have grown both organically and by merger, in many cases combining multiple bank subsidiaries of the same BHC for efficiency.
These aggregate figures mask some significant differences between large and small banks. Total assets at the largest banks--that is, those larger than $10 billion--grew most rapidly, reaching $4.7 trillion compared with $1.4 trillion in 1992. That represents an annual growth rate of nearly 14 percent. One has to be a little careful when comparing size categories over a period of this many years. Over this period the number of banks over $10 billion grew by half--from 51 to 77--because some smaller institutions were able to grow or merge their way into this largest-size class. The advent of interstate banking provided important impetus to this process, as noted earlier.
In contrast, total assets at all community banks--that is, those with less than $1 billion in assets--have remained essentially unchanged since 1992, at just a bit above $1 trillion. Total assets at regional banks--those between $1 billion and $10 billion--actually declined over this ten-year period, falling from about the same level as community banks, to about $900 billion. The number of regional banks fell just slightly over this period, to about 320, while the number of community banks fell quite sharply under the influence of consolidation.
Despite the consolidation in the banking industry, more than 8,000 separate banks [and 1,000 thrifts] remain, and for every four bank charters that have disappeared through consolidation, one new de novo charter has been approved. While the number of banks has declined, the number of bank branches and ATM machines has consistently increased over the past decade. As for the future of state banks, 75 percent of all new charters are state bank charters. The dual banking system, which is such an important part of our financial heritage, continues, thanks in significant part to our nation's state banking commissioners, who responded to the Reigle-Neal legislation by developing home/host state bank supervision accords, which facilitated banks' wanting to branch across state lines.
Let me focus for a moment on the performance of commercial banks. Across all size categories, the banking industry continues to perform well, with strong capital and strong balance sheets. Total bank profits are at record levels, having reached $73 billion last year, and are on track for even better profits in 2002. In 2001, the industry's return on assets came in at 1.16 percent, 20 basis points better than in 1992. Community banks came in just a bit below the industrywide total--at 1.10 percent, about the same as the average thrift. This year, banks--especially community banks--have been aided by low interest rates and the accumulation of core deposits, together with more recent and modest resurgence in loan demand.
Efforts to improve earnings on equity have also resulted in differences according to bank size. The largest banks have most aggressively worked to improve their efficiency ratios and expand their sources of non-interest revenue. Not surprisingly, these banks have experienced the most improvement in their returns on equity. The smaller banks have had a much more stable return on equity--at relatively high levels, I might add. A close examination of community bank performance reveals a wide range of efficiency ratios among traditional community banks, some of which have efficiency ratios under 50 percent. The changes in return on assets among various size categories offer a somewhat different twist. All else being equal, increases in capital will result in improved returns on assets. Indeed, the banks with the most significant increases in capital are also the banks that have realized the largest improvement in return on assets.
Mortgage-related banking continues to be attractive, particularly in this interest rate environment. Although it has taken some toll on the value of mortgage-servicing rights, the recent boom in refinancings has provided a nice source of fee income. However, acquiring long-term, fixed-rate assets can also be a risky business, as we all know. Fortunately, bank and thrift managements have learned much from their experience of a decade or more ago, and financial innovation and advances in risk measurement have also helped. Financial institutions are much more aware of the complexities associated with mortgage-related activities than in earlier years and now have at their disposal better tools for measuring and managing their risks. We hope that interest rate risk will never again be the problem for depository institutions that it was for some in the 1980s.
Asset quality remains an area for attention today, with nonperforming assets at 1.16 percent of loans and about 8 percent of tier 1 capital and reserves. These figures simply do not compare with those of 1992 but tend to attract a supervisor's eye. Even at community banks, which have not been affected so much by the recent spate of highly visible problem borrowers, problem assets have increased to nearly 1 percent of loans and 6 percent of their capital and reserves. Reserve coverage of problem loans also declined, to about 1.6 times problem loans compared with about 2.0 times for 2000. The number of problem smaller institutions has increased, and the costs of several recent bank failures raise the specter of a return to significant insurance premiums.
While on the subject of the 1990s, I should note that bank lending to finance commercial real estate has grown rapidly in the last several years, especially among regional and community banks. As of June, community banks had about one-third of their loan portfolios in construction and nonfarm nonresidential lending, compared with about one-fifth ten years ago. Commercial real estate lending is, of course, a natural part of the community banking business. Although few institutions have yet encountered material problems in these portfolios, declining occupancy rates in some markets increases the risk. Underwriting practices have been much stronger than in the 1980s, but the level of concentration at regional and community banks is something that both supervisors and prudent bank managers should monitor closely.
Let me also make a brief cautionary note about the importance of good internal controls, and the need for management attention to their upkeep. This is simply good business practice, of course, but it's more than that. You may recall that a provision of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 required that banks--including many community banks--have external auditors attest to the quality and integrity of internal controls, as part of their broader program of evaluating and testing these processes. Unfortunately, in several recent examinations, bank examiners were able to identify clear internal control weaknesses that neither the banks' own processes nor outside auditors had noted. Some of these weaknesses raised safety and soundness concerns. Much more progress needs to be made in this area, and we will be following this matter closely in the coming months.
Overall, it is clear that U.S. depository institutions, including commercial banks, stock and mutual thrifts, remain sound, with still historically strong profitability, capital ratios, and loan portfolios. Without becoming complacent, the industry can take comfort, so far, that it has withstood the last decade, and the more recent economic weakness, quite well. That said, it will be important for bankers to stay on top of their asset quality and internal controls. The increased sophistication in technology and product development has actually increased the need for these controls.
In conclusion, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss these issues with you today. The past decade has been a time of dynamic change in the financial services industry and there are no signs that the pace of change will abate. The challenge for regulators and the industry is to revisit our assumptions, views, and policies frequently and to respond in a manner that continues to ensure a sound and competitive financial system.'''

a_2002_12 = '''I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts with you on the U.S. economy. Of course, the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. As you all know, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered the federal funds rate target last week in response to an apparent softening in near-term economic prospects. I’ll come back to that decision and share some of my thoughts about the effectiveness of expansionary monetary policy in stimulating aggregate demand. But before doing so, I think it is useful to set the stage by talking about some notable aspects of the economic recovery currently under way and some possible reasons why the economy has taken this particular course.
Like its predecessor in 1990-91, the most recent recession was relatively mild; and the current recovery, compared with previous recoveries, has similarly been restrained. The NBER has not officially declared a business cycle trough. But using the fourth quarter of last year as a benchmark, the peak-to-trough decline in the level of real gross domestic product was just 0.6 percent, matched in its shallowness in the post-World War II period only by the 1970 recession. And according to the Commerce Department’s latest estimate, through the first three quarters of this year the economy has grown a little more than 3 percent at an annual rate, compared with an average increase in GDP of about 5-1/2 percent during the first four quarters following previous business-cycle troughs. Only in 1991-92 was the increase in GDP slower than in the current recovery.
As is typical, the expansion this year was aided by a waning of an earlier sharp runoff of business inventories. But some other features of the current recovery seem at odds with historical experience. For example, despite the relatively modest pace of output growth, productivity gains have been atypically large this year. In the long run, strong growth of productivity is unambiguously positive, as it implies that the prospects for increases in the general standard of living remain favorable. But the recent performance also is likely a sign that businesses are being unusually cautious in their hiring. Indeed, the labor market has not yet materially improved in the current expansion. The level of private payroll employment in October is still only marginally above the April low. And the unemployment rate has come down only slightly from its 6 percent peak earlier this year.
Another symptom of business caution is the sluggish rise in business investment compared with previous recoveries. In contrast, the household sector has been a source of strength this year. Housing starts and sales have been at their highest levels in years. Motor vehicle sales have been running well above normal levels for much of the year. And consumer spending apart from motor vehicles rose at a relatively robust pace over the first half of the year.
What accounts for the unusual nature of this recovery? I think that there are several factors at work. First, the downturn in 2001 itself exhibited some unusual features that have contributed to the patterns of economic growth this year. As I just noted, the recession was relatively mild. As a result, some of the elements of spending that normally rebound sharply from very depressed levels fell less this time and thus had less room in which to recover. This pattern is most evident in the housing sector, where home sales--and new construction--remained at elevated levels through the recession and beyond. But a lack of pent-up demand coming out of the recession was also noticeable in other areas of household spending, especially consumer durables other than motor vehicles.
In addition, the 2001 downturn was led by a collapse in business spending, especially for equipment and software. In the past fifty years, investment spending has nearly always begun its decline one to four quarters after the peak of the economic cycle, not before it. In the most recent cycle, however, the main source of the economic shock to demand was a large drop in capital expenditures.
In retrospect, this downturn in investment seems to have been caused by an overbuilding of capital stocks in the late 1990s, especially in high-tech equipment. The boom in high-tech spending appears to have been sparked by the confluence of three key trends: the rapid growth in computing power generated by dramatic advances in semiconductor technology; the advent of new networking technologies that permitted computers to communicate more easily with each other in private networks and through the public Internet; and the development of software programs that facilitated these interactions and greatly expanded the use of personal computers. During this period of rapid change, the rate of return to investing in these new technologies and applications looked to be very high. These perceived high rates of return encouraged new firms, supported by investors eager for windfall financial gains, to enter these markets, and induced a record-setting expansion of capital spending. As it turned out, however, some of these investments were overly optimistic and capital markets were not sufficiently discriminating. The expected returns to the new equipment did not materialize, and many of the new high-tech start-ups went bankrupt. As a result, the economy was left with a bulge in corporate defaults for investors to absorb, and an overhang of high-tech capital, which has subsequently exerted a substantial drag on business spending and economic activity.
The shakeout in the high-tech sector also contributed to a sharp decline in the stock market, and the resulting negative wealth effect has restrained consumer outlays. Nevertheless, household spending, aided by solid income gains that were fueled by continued productivity growth and income tax cuts, held up quite well during the economic downturn. That strength has continued into this year, supported by low interest rates and substantial motor vehicle incentives. But, as I noted above, the absence of pent-up demand among consumers has limited the extent to which the household sector has contributed to growth this year. And the recent data on consumer spending have had a weaker tone of late as households continue to adjust to the hit taken by their balance sheets.
In addition, foreign economic growth has remained relatively anemic. Real GDP gains this year are running at annual rates of only 1 percent to 1-1/2 percent in the euro area and Japan, and output is falling in parts of South America. This weakness in foreign activity has restrained the demand for our exports, with adverse consequences for U.S. manufacturers.
Another factor that seems to be limiting the economic recovery is the substantial uncertainty confronting decisionmakers. In particular, a series of unusual shocks has significantly buffeted the economy over the past year or so. Chief among these were the terrorist attacks of September 11. The worst effects were obviously felt by the people directly touched by the tragedies. But the attacks also dealt a blow to our already weakened economy. Several industries were seriously affected--the air travel and airplane manufacturing industries being the clearest examples--and activity in these industries is still well below its levels just before the attacks. The economy has proved to be more resilient than many initially anticipated, but the threat of additional attacks has undoubtedly affected some business decisions.
This year, concerns about the adequacy of corporate governance have greatly increased. These concerns likely contributed to the pullback in the stock market this summer. Moreover, lenders have responded to the sequence of accounting irregularities, and even sound businesses have been affected by the additional caution and suspicions arising in the wake of the disclosures by Enron, Worldcom, and the like. In particular, these announcements probably heightened investors’ perceptions of risk and thus likely contributed to the widening in risk spreads in recent months.
More recently, geopolitical risks also seem to be weighing on businesses and households. The possibility of additional terrorist attacks has been present for some time. But added to this concern are now the prospects for armed conflict. Predicting the consequences of such an event with any precision is, of course, impossible, and this additional uncertainty has undoubtedly increased caution among businesses and perhaps even households.
Indeed, as I noted at the outset, indicators of production and spending have recently become more downbeat. Industrial production fell in both August and September, in part--but not solely--because of a dropback in motor vehicle production from the high rates earlier in the summer. Payroll employment has turned down again after rising this summer. And layoffs and initial claims for unemployment insurance continue to run at elevated levels. On the household spending side, motor vehicle sales dropped off sharply in September and October after a phenomenal pace this summer; personal consumption expenditures excluding motor vehicles were little changed in both August and September; and consumer confidence has deteriorated of late. Similarly, business spending has shown little vigor in recent months, at least judging by the latest data on new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods.
Taking account of these latest signals, the climate of heightened uncertainty, and the very favorable prospects for inflation, the FOMC last week cut the target for the funds rate by 50 basis points. This additional easing of policy is aimed at helping the economy work through the current soft spot, and the FOMC indicated that it better balances the risks to the outlook.
Not everyone will agree with this view. In particular, the fact that the economy has grown at only a moderate pace this year despite sizable reductions in interest rates over the past year and a half has led some observers to argue that monetary policy has lost its punch. In my opinion, that argument is wrong. Academics and policymakers always thought that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags and that both the level of rates and the time required for policy to have the desired equilibrating effect depend greatly on the force of the macroeconomic instability that must be confronted. To judge the effectiveness of monetary policy, one must consider what the economy would have looked like in the absence of easing. In this light, given the severity of the shocks that have hit the economy, a better interpretation may well be that recent events validate once again the potency of monetary policy.
In my judgment, monetary policy has, in fact, countered some of the negative forces weighing on the economy. Residential investment has no doubt been buoyed by policy easing, as lower mortgage rates offset the restraint from declines in employment, smaller gains in income, and lower levels of wealth. Lower interest rates have also made it attractive to refinance mortgages to reduce monthly payments, extract some buildup of home equity, and use the proceeds to pay down more-expensive forms of consumer credit, finance additional purchases, or pay for home renovations.
Businesses, which have been feeling the pinch of lower corporate profits, have benefited from lower interest rates as well. For example, the low rates have facilitated the financing incentives used by automakers to stimulate motor vehicle sales this year. And businesses more generally have taken advantage of lower long-term rates by issuing bonds and paying down commercial paper and bank loans.
Even so, the current environment of low inflation and concerns about the recovery have raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve will eventually run out of room to lower interest rates by enough to stimulate the economy. However, I do not think that macroeconomic outcomes will be sufficiently adverse to place us in imminent danger of hitting the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates. Even more remote is the possibility that monetary policy will be unable to prevent deflation.
To be sure, many firms, especially in the goods-producing sector, are experiencing declining prices. Goods prices have been declining this year, reflecting, in part, productivity improvements. Distinct from changes in relative prices, a general deflation would be disturbing both because it would be widely unexpected and because it would undermine the ability of monetary policy to operate through traditional channels.
I believe the risks of a general deflation are remote, as I will explain shortly. On that score, measures of overall price inflation are still running in the range of about 1-1/2 percent at an annual rate for the GDP and core PCE price indexes to a bit more than 2 percent for the core consumer price index. However, I also believe that complacency in this regard is inappropriate. The economics literature advises preemptive and aggressive action to minimize the risks of deflation. In the unlikely event that our nation should face such a challenge, I believe that the Federal Reserve would demonstrate a commitment to such timely and decisive action.
For several reasons, I think that the probability that the United States will end up in a position of general deflation is extremely low. For one thing, we’ve clearly learned the lessons of history, both the distant past of the United States and the more recent experience of other nations. Monetary and fiscal policies in the United States were quick to react to the mounting evidence that the decline in business spending that began in late 2000 was likely to be prolonged and severe. In January 2001, the Federal Reserve began to cut rates and by the end of last year had reduced the funds rate target more than 400 basis points, to its lowest level in forty years. Similarly, fiscal policy provided stimulus to the household sector at a time when household wealth was deteriorating.
In addition, the balance sheets of our financial firms appear to be in relatively good shape. Banks are well capitalized and don’t have the severe nonperforming loan problems that have been plaguing Japan. Of course, banks are being careful lenders, and the supply of credit does appear to have tightened more recently, especially for less creditworthy borrowers. But the primary reason for weak net business borrowing this year seems to be a lack of demand, and in general, credit appears to be available to higher quality borrowers in both the business and the household sectors.
The underlying structure of the U.S. economy also seems fundamentally sound, reducing the risks going forward. After the substantial reductions of the past year and a half, inventories in most areas appear to be at comfortable levels. There are no doubt places where capital goods imbalances are still quite large--communications equipment and aircraft being two notable examples. But in other sectors, companies have remained profitable, and in the aggregate, the underlying picture of corporate profits and capital spending is not so bleak as the experiences of some industries might suggest. Indeed, as measured in the national income and product accounts, economic profits in the third quarter were well above year-earlier levels. And real investment in equipment and software, while not rising at the torrid pace of 2000, appears to have bottomed out and may be increasing.
Moreover, the longer-term prospects for economic growth in the United States continue to look favorable. A key question in assessing those longer-run prospects is whether productivity growth in the years ahead will more closely resemble the substantial gains evident since 1995 or whether it will revert to the weaker performance of the period from 1973 to 1995. The most recent record of productivity growth reinforces the view that future growth will follow the higher trend of the past half-decade. Productivity is a cyclical variable that typically falls in recessions. However, during the most recent downturn, productivity never declined and instead continued to grow at a fairly strong pace. Moreover, after September 11, many economists feared that productivity growth would suffer a severe setback as businesses diverted resources to improving security and developing contingencies in the event of another terrorist attack. Instead, according to Labor Department data released last week, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector has risen 5.3 percent over the past four quarters, its best performance since 1983.
How should we interpret this truly extraordinary performance? Cyclical forces probably played some role. And, as I noted, increased caution has probably pushed many companies to find ways to get more productivity from their workers. But these efficiency gains were likely facilitated by the capital investments of recent years. Adjusting to new technologies takes time, and it is plausible that such an adjustment process has continued to boost productivity this year. While cyclical forces and lags in the assimilation of new technologies have been important, their influence is likely to be transitory. More fundamentally, I believe that the trend in productivity has ratcheted up, and this development has been the driving force behind the recent extraordinary productivity growth.
Thus, it seems to me that with last week’s easing in monetary policy, the pieces are in place to engender a gradual strengthening in economic activity in coming quarters. With the real federal funds rate now below zero, monetary policy is providing considerable support to the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Similarly, fiscal policy remains conducive to growth. The uncertain mood among businesspeople--and more recently households--may continue to damp spending for a while longer. But with inventories now seemingly in better alignment with sales and with much of the restructuring associated with the high-tech overhang now behind us, some important sources of economic weakness over the past two years should begin to disappear. As a result, with underlying productivity gains likely to remain strong, business profits and household income should resume their uptrend, setting the stage for a renewed pickup in private spending growth.
Of course, with inflation quite low and with significant excess capacity remaining in labor and product markets, we will need to remain watchful for any additional signs of economic weakness. Households surely won’t be able to maintain spending growth indefinitely without renewed gains in employment, and a pickup in job creation will require that businesses become more sanguine about their future profit opportunities. At the Federal Reserve, we will continue to weigh incoming data and changing forecasts. But I expect that the economy will pull out of this period of weakness and that the natural resilience of the economy and the stimulative effects of monetary and fiscal policy will show through more clearly over the coming year.'''

a_2002_17 = '''It is an honor to be here this evening to accept the Stephen P. Duggan Award for International Understanding. After a year during which violence and terror have so engaged our public discussions both here and abroad, I appreciate this opportunity to share with you some more civilizing and constructive thoughts. I plan to address the important role that education has played in raising standards of living, especially in the United States, and in contributing to positive social and economic relationships across the globe.
Although I will focus on institutions of formal education, we need to be reminded that people have been educating themselves one way or the other since the dawn of history. Our faculty for rational thought has carried us one arduous step at a time into a deeper understanding of how the world works. Decade by decade, scholars have recorded their insights, building knowledge from one generation to the next. Although wars, international conflicts, and economic crises have interrupted our progress from time to time, we have, nonetheless, persisted in learning to use our hard-won knowledge to alter our physical and social environment for the better. Especially notable has been our application of both scientific advances and organizational paradigms to raise living standards across most of the population, and, as a consequence, engender marked increases in average longevity and quality of life.
Over the last century, for example, real gross domestic product in the United States has grown at an average of more than 3 percent per year. Only a small fraction of that increased value represents a rise in the tonnage of physical materials--oil, coal, ores, wood, and raw chemicals, for example. The remainder represents new insights into how to rearrange those physical materials to better serve human needs.
This process has enabled valued goods to be transported more easily and to be produced with ever fewer workers, allowing a more efficient division of labor to propel overall output and standards of living progressively higher.
The share of the nation's output that is conceptual appears to have accelerated after World War II with the insights that led to the development of the transistor and microprocessor. They have spawned remarkable alterations in how we, and many other societies, live.
Computers, telecommunications, and satellite technologies have enabled data and ideas--the ever more important elements of valued output--to be expeditiously transferred geographically to where they can be put to best use. Thus, these advanced means of communication have added much the same type of value that the railroads added in transporting the more-physical goods of an earlier century.
Here in the United States, we have developed an exceptionally sophisticated stock of capital assets--fostered by the most conceptual and intangible of all new products--software. Breakthroughs in all areas of technology--despite the recent slowdown--have been continually adding to the growing list of almost wholly conceptual elements in our economic output. These developments are affecting how we produce output and are demanding greater specialized knowledge.
In broad terms, the available empirical economic research has identified a complex of factors as key determinants of how successful any country will be in transforming its physical and human assets into economic growth: openness to trade, a strong institutional infrastructure, disciplined macroeconomic policies, and an effective system of education--formal or otherwise. Although the relative contribution of any single factor remains under debate, most observers would agree that the success of these factors in accounting for relative rates of economic growth across countries lies importantly in the interactions of the determinants themselves. An educated workforce, then, is a necessary ingredient for economic advance, but it is apparently much more powerful when combined with a strong, competitive economic system, where rights of persons and property are protected.
In that regard, an economist can scarcely fail to notice the advantages that we have accrued in this country by having the marketplace work efficiently to guide our educational system, defined in its widest sense, toward the broader needs of our economy.
The history of education in the United States traces a path heavily influenced by the need for a workforce with the skills required to interact productively with the evolving economic structure. Over the generations, technological advance has brought with it not only improvements in the capital inputs used in production but also new demands on workers who must interact with that increasingly more complex stock of capital. Early last century, these advances required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills--for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulas.
Our educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more productive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet the needs of an advancing manufacturing sector. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work life, not just for a transition to college. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for having a high school diploma rose and, as a result, high school enrollment rates climbed.
By the time that the United States entered World War II, the median eighteen year-old was a high school graduate--an accomplishment that set us apart from other countries. I should note that I regret that, more recently, international comparisons have not been so favorable; tests of student achievement in mathematics and science suggest that our high schoolers have been falling short of their peers in other countries. I trust that this degradation will prove to be transitory.
As was the case with our high schools, the evolution of our system of higher education was also influenced importantly by the need to respond to advances in economic processes. Although many states had established land grant schools earlier, their support strengthened in the late nineteenth century as those whose economies specialized in agriculture and mining sought to take advantage of new scientific methods of production.
Early in the twentieth century, the content of education at an American college had evolved from a classically based curriculum to one combining the sciences, empirical studies, and modern liberal arts. Universities responded to the need for the application of science--particularly chemistry and physics--to the manufacture of steel, rubber, chemicals, drugs, petroleum, and other goods requiring the newer production technologies. Communities looked to their institutions of higher learning for leadership in scientific knowledge and for training of professionals such as teachers and engineers. The scale and scope of higher education in America was being shaped by the recognition that research--the creation of knowledge--complemented teaching and training--the diffusion of knowledge. In broad terms, the basic structure of higher education remains much the same today, and it has been one that has proven sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of a changing economy.
Market economies have succeeded over the centuries by granting rewards to those who could anticipate changes in the value preferences of society. America's system of higher education has evolved into a highly diverse and complex range of institutions--large research universities that combine undergraduate and graduate offerings, small liberal arts colleges, and vocation-oriented community colleges--all seeking their competitive advantage. What makes that system work effectively is that it has been influenced importantly by the values of a strong market economy--competition, risk-taking, and innovation.
America's reputation as a world leader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions, taken together, to serve the practical needs of an economy and, more important, to unleash the creative thinking that moves a society forward. It is the recognition of these values that has attracted such a large segment of the world student population to our institutions of higher learning.
In a global environment in which prospects for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's capacity to develop and apply new technologies, the research facilities of our universities are world class. The payoffs--in terms of the flow of expertise, new products, and start-up companies, for example--have been impressive. With the emergence of significant centers of commercial innovation and entrepreneurship--Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle, and the clustering of biotech enterprises in the Northeast corridor--creative ideas flow freely between local academic scholars and those in industry. Those ventures that succeeded have materially added to our base of knowledge. But even those that failed, as many did, left residual insights that may spark future research.
Beyond these highly visible achievements, what has made our research universities so extraordinarily productive is their promotion of peer-reviewed scholarship and the value they place on creativity and risk-taking. Although some innovations move quickly from the development stage to applications, we usually cannot accurately predict which particular scientific advance, or synergy of advances, will ultimately prove valuable.
One has only to recall our experience with the laser, which had to wait for improvements in fiber optics to yield important applications. Indeed, according to Nobel Laureate Charles Townes, in the late 1960s the attorneys for Bell Labs initially refused to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field of telecommunications. Our universities have shown the patience and the flexibility to accept that uncertainty, confident that the rigorous effort to explore ideas would eventually lead to discovery.
What our colleges and universities produce is obviously highly valued in today's economy. The rise in that value over the past several decades has been reflected in a widening spread between compensation paid to college-educated workers relative to those with less schooling. This increased investment in college-trained human capital has resulted in a flow of labor input into the economy that has made an important ongoing contribution to U.S. economic growth.
Early in the twentieth century, high school education was challenged to meet the needs of an evolving economy; in the twenty-first century, our institutions of higher learning will bear the enormous responsibility of ensuring that our society is prepared for the demands of rapid economic change. We must ensure that teaching and research continue to supply the creative intellectual energy that drives our system forward. As the conceptual inputs to the value added in our economic processes continue to grow, the ability to think abstractly will be increasingly important across a broad range of professions. Critical awareness and the abilities to hypothesize, to interpret, and to communicate are essential elements of successful innovation in a conceptual-based economy.
The roots and nature of how the human mind innovates have always been subject to controversy. Yet, even without hard indisputable evidence, a remarkable and broad presumption is that the ability to think conceptually is fostered through exposure to philosophy, literature, music, art, and languages. So-called liberal education is presumed to spawn a greater understanding of all aspects of living--an essential ingredient to broaden one's world view. As the President of the University of Pennsylvania, Judith Rodin, put it, such an understanding comes by "vaulting over disciplinary walls" and exploring other fields of study. Most great conceptual advances are interdisciplinary and involve synergies of different specialities.
Yet the liberal arts embody more than a means of increasing technical intellectual efficiency. They encourage the appreciation of life experiences that reach beyond material well-being and, indeed, are comparable and mutually reinforcing. The intense pleasure many experience from listening to Mozart's great D Minor Piano Concerto has much in common with the deep satisfaction of solving a complex mathematical problem. The challenge for our institutions of higher education is to successfully blend the exposure to all aspects of human intellectual activity, especially our artistic propensities and our technical skills.
The challenge is particularly daunting because scientific knowledge expands and broadens the measurable rewards of its curriculum at a pace that liberal arts, by their nature, have difficulty matching. The depth of knowledge in nuclear physics is today far greater than it was a century ago, and useful teaching hours have doubtless expanded many fold. But do the same possibilities exist for courses in English literature?
Similar differences between science and the arts arise in the nonacademic world: Engineering and metallurgical insights have reduced the number of people required to produce a ton of steel, but the same number of musicians will be needed to perform a Beethoven quartet this evening as were needed a century ago. Many of you will recognize this application of Baumol's law. To make the point even more graphically, Daniel Patrick Moynihan has noted that the Minute Waltz could be played in fifty seconds, but he wondered whether it would sound as good.
Overwhelmed with the increasing scientific knowledge base, our universities are going to have to struggle to prevent the liberal arts curricula from being swamped by technology and science. This institute, by encouraging Americans to seek wider educational experiences abroad, is doing its part to prevent that from happening.
The advent of the twenty-first century will certainly bring new challenges for our society and for our education system. We cannot know the precise directions in which advances in technology, conceptual thinking, and the transmission of knowledge will take us. However, we can be certain that our institutions of higher education will remain at the center of the endeavor to comprehend those profound changes and to seize the opportunities to direct them toward ever-rising standards of living and quality of life.
A global society reflects an ever more open economic environment in which participants are free to engage in commerce, finance, and education wherever in the world the possibilities of increased value added arise. The breaking down of barriers to commerce fosters ever greater cross-border contact and further exploitation of the values of specialization, but on a global scale.
Fear of terrorist acts, however, has the potential to induce disengagement from activities, both domestic and cross-border. If we allow terrorism to undermine our freedom of action, we could reverse at least part of the palpable gains to the United States and our trading partners achieved by postwar economic integration. It is incumbent upon us not to allow that to happen.
In that regard, I was pleased to hear that the recent survey that your organization conducted among international education professionals showed no diminution of enthusiasm for study abroad by U.S. students and for study in the United States by international students. As your President, Allan Goodman, remarked, this is a time for more international exchange, not less, and a time for open, not closed, minds.'''

a_2002_31 = '''It is a pleasure to be here with you tonight to discuss innovations in the management of risk and to address some of the implications of those innovations for our global financial and economic systems.
Fostered by a lowering of trade barriers, exchange of goods and services across borders has increased far faster than world gross domestic product. But what is even more remarkable is how large the scale of cross-border finance has become, relative to the value of the trade that it finances. To be sure, much global finance reflects growing investment portfolios, some doubtless with a speculative component. But, at bottom, such finance is a central element of the systems that support the efficient international movement of goods and services.
We strongly suspect, though we do not know for sure, that the accelerating expansion of global finance may be indispensable to the continued rapid growth in world trade in goods and services. It appears increasingly evident that many forms and layers of financial intermediation will be required if we are to capture the full benefit of our advances in technology and trade. Indeed, the potential for a far larger world financial system than currently exists is suggested by the seemingly outsized implicit compensation for risk associated with many investments worldwide.
But, as in all aspects of life, expansion of one’s activities beyond previously explored territory involves taking risks. And risk by its nature has carried, and always will carry with it, the possibility of adverse outcomes. Accordingly, for globalization to continue to foster expanding living standards, risk must be managed ever more effectively as the century unfolds.
The development of our paradigms for containing risk has emphasized, and will, of necessity, continue to emphasize dispersion of risk to those willing, and presumably able, to bear it. If risk is properly dispersed, shocks to the overall economic system will be better absorbed and less likely to create cascading failures that could threaten financial stability.
The broad success of that paradigm seemed to be most evident in the United States over the past two and one-half years. Despite the draining impact of a loss of $8 trillion of stock market wealth, a sharp contraction in capital investment and, of course, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, our economy held firm. Importantly, despite significant losses, no major U.S. financial institution was driven to default. Similar observations pertain to much of the rest of the world but to a somewhat lesser extent than to the United States.
These episodes suggest a marked increase over the past two or three decades in the ability of modern economies to absorb shocks. To be sure, the recent tepid pace of world economic activity has raised concerns that the full cycle of the past decade has yet to be definitively concluded. But the increased resiliency now clearly evident arguably supports the view that the world economy already has become more flexible. This favorable turn of events has doubtless been materially assisted by the recent financial innovations that have afforded lenders the opportunity to become considerably more diversified and borrowers to become far less dependent on specific institutions or markets for funds.
A major contributor to the dispersion of risk in recent decades has been the wide-ranging development of markets in securitized bank loans, credit card receivables, and commercial and residential mortgages. These markets have tailored the risks associated with holding such assets to fit the preferences of a broader spectrum of investors.
Especially important in the United States has been the flexibility and size of the secondary mortgage market. Since early 2000, this market has facilitated the large debt-financed extraction of home equity that, in turn, has been so critical in supporting consumer outlays in the United States throughout the recent period of cyclical stress. This market’s flexibility has been particularly enhanced by extensive use of interest rate swaps and options to hedge maturity mismatches and prepayment risk.
Financial derivatives, more generally, have grown at a phenomenal pace over the past fifteen years. Conceptual advances in pricing options and other complex financial products, along with improvements in computer and telecommunications technologies, have significantly lowered the costs of, and expanded the opportunities for, hedging risks that were not readily deflected in earlier decades. Moreover, the counterparty credit risk associated with the use of derivative instruments has been mitigated by legally enforceable netting and through the growing use of collateral agreements. These increasingly complex financial instruments have been especial contributors, particularly over the past couple of stressful years, to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and resilient financial system than existed just a quarter-century ago.
Greater resilience has been evident in many segments of the financial markets. One prominent example is the response of financial markets to a burgeoning and then deflating telecom sector. Worldwide borrowing by telecom firms in all currencies amounted to more than the equivalent of a trillion U.S. dollars during the years 1998 to 2001. The financing of the massive expansion of fiber-optic networks and heavy investments in third-generation mobile-phone licenses by European firms strained debt markets.
At the time, the financing of these investments was widely seen as prudent because the telecom borrowers had very high valuations in equity markets that could facilitate a stock issuance, if needed, to take down bank loans and other debt. In the event, of course, prices of telecom stocks collapsed, and many firms went bankrupt. In decades past, such a sequence would have been a recipe for creating severe distress in the wider financial system. However, a significant amount of exposure to telecom debt had been laid off through instruments that mitigate credit risk, such as credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and credit-linked notes. Taken together, these instruments appear to have significantly reduced telecom loan concentrations and the associated stress on banks and other financial institutions.
More generally, such instruments appear to have effectively spread losses from defaults by Enron, Global Crossing, Railtrack, WorldCom, and Swissair in recent months from financial institutions with largely short-term leverage to insurance firms, pension funds, or others with diffuse long-term liabilities or no liabilities at all. In particular, the still relatively small but rapidly growing market in credit derivatives has to date functioned well, with payouts proceeding smoothly for the most part. Obviously, this market is still too new to have been tested in a widespread down-cycle for credit. But so far, so good.
The growing prominence of the market for credit derivatives is attributable not only to its ability to disperse risk but also to the information it contributes to enhanced risk management by banks and other financial intermediaries. Credit default swaps, for example, are priced to reflect the probability of the net loss from the default of an ever broadening array of borrowers, both financial and nonfinancial.
As the market for credit default swaps expands and deepens, the collective knowledge held by market participants is exactly reflected in the prices of these derivative instruments. They offer significant supplementary information about credit risk to a bank’s loan officer, for example, who heretofore had to rely mainly on in-house credit analysis. To be sure, loan officers have always looked to the market prices of the stocks and bonds of a potential borrower for guidance, but none directly answered the key question for any prospective loan: What is the probable net loss in a given time frame? Credit default swaps, of course, do just that and presumably in the process embody all relevant market prices of the financial instruments issued by potential borrowers.
Price trends of default swaps have been particularly sensitive to concerns about corporate governance in recent months. The perceived risk of default of both financial and nonfinancial firms has risen markedly in the wake of company-threatening scandals, though levels remain moderate.
* * *
Derivatives, by construction, are highly leveraged, a condition that is both a large benefit and an Achilles’ heel. The benefits of risk dispersion are accomplished without holding massive positions in the underlying financial instruments. Yet, too often in our financially checkered past, the access to such leverage has induced speculative excesses that have led to financial grief. We are scarcely likely to reform the underlying human traits that lead to excess, but we do need to buttress our risk management capabilities as best we can to delimit such detours from the path of balanced growth.
More fundamentally, we should recognize that if we choose to enjoy the advantages of a system of leveraged financial intermediaries, the burden of managing risk in the financial system will not lie with the private sector alone. Leveraging always carries with it the remote possibility of a chain reaction, a cascading sequence of defaults that will culminate in financial implosion if it proceeds unchecked. Only a central bank, with its unlimited power to create money, can with a high probability thwart such a process before it becomes destructive. Hence, central banks have, of necessity, been drawn into becoming lenders of last resort.
It was the Bank of England that established the concept during the financial crises of the nineteenth century, even though it was at the time privately owned. When a prominent London discount house failed in 1866, the Bank of England lent a substantial share of its reserves to other financial firms to ensure that panic did not spread. It further established its role as lender of last resort in 1890, when Baring Brothers was threatened. The Bank initiated a successful rescue operation by establishing a guarantee fund to which other financial institutions also contributed. Writing in 1915 about that episode, Ellis Powell said, “The Bank is not a single combatant who must fight or retire, but the leader of the most colossal agglomeration of financial power which the world has so far witnessed.”
Thus, although the Bank of England was not nationalized until 1946, it had long before taken on one of the main responsibilities of modern central banks: ensuring financial stability by serving as the lender of last resort.
But implicit in such a role is the assumption that the burden of risk arising from extreme outcomes will in some way be allocated between the public and private sectors. Thus, central banks are led to provide what essentially amounts to catastrophic financial insurance coverage. Such a public subsidy should be reserved for only the rarest of occasions. If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped up frequently by government support, it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices.
In theory, the allocation of responsibility for risk bearing between the private sector and the central bank depends upon the private cost of capital. To attract capital, or at least retain it, a private financial institution must earn at minimum the overall economy’s rate of return, adjusted for risk. In competitive financial markets, the greater the leverage, the higher must be the rate of return on the invested capital before adjustment for risk.
If private financial institutions have to absorb all financial risk, then the degree to which they can leverage will be limited, the financial sector smaller, and its contribution to the economy more limited. On the other hand, if central banks effectively insulate private institutions from the largest potential losses, however incurred, increased laxity could threaten a major drain on taxpayers, excess creation of money by the central bank, or both. In the end, we would be faced with a severe misallocation of real capital.
In practice, the policy choice of how much, if any, extreme market risk should be absorbed by government authorities is fraught with many complexities. Yet we central bankers make this decision every day, either explicitly, or implicitly through inadvertence. Moreover, we can never know for sure whether the decisions we make are appropriate. The question is not whether our actions are seen to have been necessary in retrospect; the absence of a fire does not mean that we should not have paid for fire insurance. Rather, the question is whether, ex ante, the probability of a systemic collapse was sufficient to warrant intervention. Often, we cannot wait to see whether, in hindsight, the problem will be judged to have been an isolated event and largely benign.
Thus, governments, including central banks, must balance the responsibilities they have been given related to their banking and financial systems. We have the responsibility to prevent major financial market disruptions through development and enforcement of prudent regulatory standards and, if necessary in rare circumstances, through direct intervention in market events. But we also have the responsibility to ensure that the regulatory framework permits private sector institutions to take prudent and appropriate risks, even though such risks will sometimes result in unanticipated bank losses or even bank failures.
The inevitable rise in potential systemic risks as the international financial system inexorably expands can be contained by improvements in effective risk management in the private sector, improvements in domestic bank supervision and regulation, and, should it be necessary, by central banks acting as lenders of last resort. In the past two decades, bank supervisors in developed countries have worked together, through the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to improve bank supervision and regulation. This effort, which was the outgrowth of cooperation between U.S. and U.K. supervisory authorities, is ongoing and places priority on encouraging banks to further improve their risk management systems. Similar efforts toward shared objectives among individual central banks should also improve protection against systemic risk on an international level.
* * *
Allowing free markets to foster an ever-expanding international division of labor will in the future, as in the past, be fraught with controversy even as the evidence of the success of such a paradigm mounts. The wealth creation of globalization results from cutting-edge technologies displacing obsolescent facilities. But that implies significant hardship for workers who lose their jobs. These inevitable victims of the process of creative destruction must be aided not only for humanitarian reasons, but also to prevent our democratic institutions, in frustration, from turning to self-destructive protectionism. Such concerns underscore the fact that the battle for free markets is never definitively won. It is thus incumbent on those who seek to advance human welfare through the global system of free market trading to persevere in their advocacy.
While the origin of global trade has its roots deep in human history, the emergence of the Industrial Revolution more than two centuries ago here in Britain accelerated global trade to levels previously unimagined. Britain also pioneered the development of political institutions to support free trade and more generally led the way into the modern industrial world. While there remain many who believe civilization took a wrong turn at that time, I doubt that any of the protesters of modern capitalism would choose to live in an environment that produced a life expectancy a fraction of what most of the world now enjoys.
* * *
But beyond our mutual commitment to global trade, Britain and the United States share a more enduring bond between our peoples. This bond reflects a shared set of deep-seated values that govern the way our citizens deal with one another, and how we deal with others. Undeniably, over the generations, the interests of Britain and the United States have at times diverged. We had a few differences with George III, for example.
But I cannot forget the dinner President Ford gave in honor of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip in celebration of the two-hundredth anniversary of our Declaration of Independence. The near-desperate requests for dinner invitations from all segments of our society across the continent led me to wonder whether Americans subliminally still viewed the British monarchy as our own.
Americans will visit Britain as extended family as far into the future as one can project. I suspect even George III would approve.'''

a_2002_38 = '''I am very pleased to participate in the Finance Forum 2002. As a former banker and current bank supervisor, I would like to focus my remarks on the process of building a strong system of financial supervision and regulation. Generally speaking, I believe a sound supervisory framework must be dynamic and must closely mirror the realities of the financial sector for which it is created. As such, though best practices in industrial countries are an important starting point for thinking about enhancing supervisory frameworks, one also should bear in mind that a single framework very rarely fits all types of banking organizations or banking systems.
My comments today will include an overview of the evolution of banking supervision in the United States, a discussion of the fundamental elements of our system, and a review of aspects of the U.S. experience that may provide lessons for supervisory development in emerging markets. I would like to conclude my remarks with a discussion of a basic supervisory issue related to foreign banking organizations that continues to challenge supervisory agencies around the world.
Evolution of the U.S. Supervisory System
In the not-too-distant past, the Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies in the United States relied considerably on validating financial accounts and records during on-site examinations to assess the safety and soundness of banking organizations. Examiners also spent significant time valuing account balances by performing detailed reviews of individual loans and other risk assets. Labor-intensive efforts went into verifying compliance with banking laws, regulations, and reporting requirements, and testing the adequacy of internal controls. These procedures enabled examiners to obtain a detailed assessment of a banking organization’s financial condition at the time of the examination. Since examinations were conducted annually and the banking business changed slowly during most of the post World War II war period, this framework provided supervisors with a reasonable assessment of the safety and soundness of the banking industry.
However, as you are aware, by the 1990s the pace of consolidation, expansion, and innovation in the U.S. banking industry had begun to accelerate, particularly among the largest institutions. The emergence of large, complex banking organizations and their use of new financial instruments, particularly derivatives, enabled these organizations to change their risk profiles rapidly. As a result, the point-in-time evaluations derived from transaction validation and valuation-oriented banking supervision became insufficient to ensure that banking organizations, particularly large complex banking organizations, were operating in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, the increased complexity and volume of financial transactions across the largest institutions began to significantly strain examiner resources.
Along with financial innovation, the risk management systems of banking organizations also began to evolve around this time because of advances in information technology, which significantly reduced the cost of obtaining and analyzing data and increased the sophistication of risk management models. More sophisticated risk management systems gave banking institutions a more accurate view of their risk-adjusted returns on capital. Value-at-risk models were adopted to measure expected losses at given levels of probability, and financial products such as swaps and other derivatives were used to manage interest-rate risk more effectively. On the credit side, where banks already had access to considerable information about their borrowers, more sophisticated risk-modeling techniques complimented management’s views on credit risk. These models include credit scoring for consumer lending and KMV models for corporate financing, which estimate option-based pricing models and information contained in stock prices with the probability of default.
As a result, the evolution of the industry in the 1990s rendered our traditional point-in-time, transaction validation, and valuation-based supervisory system inadequate. At the same time, the advancements in risk measurement in the industry allowed supervisors, when evaluating bank soundness, to rely more directly on information from banks’ own internal risk management systems. Doing so, however, necessitates testing these systems, and thus our current model of risk-focused supervision was developed.
At its core, risk-focused supervision is a relatively simple concept: Supervisors are expected to concentrate their efforts on ensuring that financial institutions use the processes necessary to identify, measure, monitor, and control risk exposures. Given the risk profile of U.S. banking organizations, risks are divided into six categories: credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational. More time has been allocated to the examination planning process, in which supervisory teams assess the most important risks facing the organization and structure their examination activities around assessing and testing the adequacy of it’s management of those important risks. Thus, in the application of risk-focused supervision in the United States, our examiners verify the adequacy of the banking organization’s risk management systems, including whether they have an appropriate degree of transaction testing.
One aspect of sound risk management that did not change during the 1990s is the importance of sound corporate governance. In particular, bank directors and senior managers are responsible for seeing that their banks have effective internal controls, including an internal audit function. Effective internal controls ensure the implementation of bank policies and procedures designed to limit and manage risks and otherwise promote sound business practices. For example, internal control procedures that give front- and back-office responsibilities to independent units within the corporation reduce the ability of individuals to hide losses from bank management and thereby reduce operating risk. An internal audit function, in turn, verifies that a bank’s internal control procedures function as intended. Therefore, another critical aspect of our system of risk-focused supervision is the bank examiners’ assessment and evaluation of a bank’s internal controls and internal audit function.
The application of risk-focused supervision in the United States is supported by a strong culture of market discipline. The extent and the content of financial disclosure in the United States have developed markedly over the past few decades through the collective efforts of the corporate sector and government authorities. Although recent events have illuminated weaknesses in the accounting and auditing professions in the United States, most knowledgeable observers believe that the quality of information released by most firms in this country continues to be sound. Further, the long-standing independence of the regulatory community in the United States has fostered an environment in which banks are expected to correct in a timely fashion and have in most cases corrected deficiencies uncovered during the supervisory process.
Our supervisory system has successfully changed to the new risk-focused approach, but the transition was difficult in the early stages, particularly for supervisory staff who had long careers in the field. Examiners at times struggled with the shift to evaluating risks and risk management systems from making independent valuations of a very large portion of an institution’s risk assets. Also, some examiners misperceived that risk-focused supervision meant eliminating even a cursory review of less-important business lines and transaction testing from the examination process. In fact, we continue to struggle with these issues under our current approach, particularly since the system has not been thoroughly tested under adverse conditions in the banking sector.
It is crucial that the new system remain both flexible in view of the rapid evolution of the banking industry and grounded in core supervisory concepts, such as maintaining an adequate control environment--an issue to which I will return at the end of my remarks.
Applicability of this System to Developing Countries
I believe that the basic principles of risk-focused supervision are relevant to most supervisory systems in industrial and developing countries. However, I would caution those attempting to introduce the U.S. supervisory model as it exists in this country to other countries, particularly where the characteristics of the banking sector differ markedly from those of the United States. Even in the United States, we have very different approaches to supervising large, complex banking organizations and smaller community banks.
First of all, the U. S. financial system is based on several fundamental factors. The first is a well-developed rule of law that enables regulators to administer their responsibilities effectively. This legal framework also ensures the enforceability of contracts, removing problems when borrowers are unwilling rather than unable to repay loans. For example, the ability to seize collateral of borrowers in default is essential if banks are to mitigate risks. As you know, difficulties in this regard have contributed to bank losses in many countries around the globe.
The second fundamental element of our system is the availability of a large volume of high-quality financial information. For both banks and corporations, a sound system of accounting and disclosure that provides accurate, timely, and complete information is needed for banks to properly assess and manage risks and for supervisors to ensure that the institutions are operating in a safe and sound manner. The third element is that the U.S. supervisory agencies are both operationally independent and sufficiently funded to carry out their duties. In addition, supervisory staff must have a basic understanding of credit analysis and risk management in banking organizations.
We also know from experience that connected lending can weaken banking systems by distorting the incentives of bank owners and managers to manage risk properly. Thus, a fourth critical element that underlies our system is restrictions on and disclosure of lending to bank affiliates, shareholders, and managers. A similar concern underlies our separation of banking and commerce, something with which I had personal experience when I worked at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis more than thirty years ago. My responsibilities included implementation of the new regulations for one-bank holding companies. For the first time one-bank holding companies no longer could have both a bank and nonfinancial subsidiary. This separation eliminates any temptation banks might have to evaluate a commercial affiliate’s loan application less objectively than that of an unaffiliated firm. In countries that are still developing their system of banking supervision, such a separation can reduce the need for bank supervisors to ensure arm’s-length transactions between banks and their commercial affiliates, thus freeing up scarce supervisory resources.
Finally, our system was established to supervise the activities of for-profit, private-sector, commercial banks, and it is wholly incompatible with a banking system that contains widespread government-directed lending. Once the responsibility for taking risk has been removed from bank managers, their incentive for monitoring and managing risk is greatly diminished. Moreover, the incentive of the supervisory authorities, which are part of the government structure, to criticize lending that was granted at the behest of the government is limited. As a result, one of the first steps toward implementing a rigorous supervisory framework must be the elimination of such practices in the banking sector.
In the absence of these fundamental elements, the application of the U.S. supervisory system and many similar systems is likely to be unsuccessful. I encourage you and your colleagues, who provide such valuable skills and resources to developing countries, to continue focusing the bulk of your attention on introducing or improving these critical elements of infrastructure for effective supervision in countries that are lacking these attributes.
In addition, as I have mentioned, one of the key aspects of our supervisory approach in the United States is our increasing reliance on the evaluation and testing of banks’ own risk management systems. This aspect of our supervisory approach probably has the least relevance for developing countries that lack the fundamental factors I have just outlined. The growing sophistication of some global banking organizations’ internal risk-rating systems has led the Basel committee to propose incorporating these models in the calculation of capital requirements under the Basel II Capital Accord. However, the use of such models in calculating capital requirements is likely to be restricted to a limited subset of internationally active banking organizations, given the model’s reliance on accurate data and the expense involved in developing these techniques. As you are undoubtedly aware, banks in countries with poor data and resource constraints are unlikely to employ high-quality risk management systems. Relying on the systems used by those banks to measure the safety and soundness of institutions may give supervisors little useful information about the condition of their banking sector.
Instead, supervisory policies and procedures created in developing countries should focus on the risk environment in that market. For example, if the information supplied by banking organizations is poor and the auditing profession is underdeveloped, examiners should focus on validating accounts and records, valuing risk assets, and verifying the accuracy of financial statements. United States supervisors played this role earlier in the evolution of our banking system. If the banking sector engages primarily in straightforward credit-extending and deposit- taking activities, a system geared toward intensive credit review and transaction testing may be more appropriate. Certainly the years of regulatory report verification and large scale transaction testing allowed our supervisory system to develop skills in assessing borrowers’ ability to repay, verifying the adequacy of internal controls, and recognizing signals that reported information may not reflect the true condition of the financial institution. It is difficult to gauge whether, without this experience, we could have shifted effectively to our current risk management intensive system of supervision.
Another issue that receives a great deal of debate in this country and in supervisory systems around the world is whether a single regulatory body is most efficient for supervising financial institutions. As you are aware, the U.S. banking supervisory system is composed of a large number of regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve has argued against the creation of a single regulatory body outside the central bank, given the valuable information that the supervisory process provides to us in maintaining financial-market stability. However, compelling arguments have been made regarding efficiencies created by housing the entire financial supervisory apparatus under one roof. In the case of developing countries, a central consideration is the structure and character of the government itself. In countries with strong traditions of bureaucratic control over economic decisionmaking, consolidating the regulatory function may prove counterproductive because that agency would have tremendous power and few checks and balances. Further, such consolidation is likely to be a larger problem if the supervisory agency is not independent of other government functions.
Current Issues Facing Global Supervisors
Finally, I would like to discuss a key issue related to the supervision of foreign banking organizations that arises in a dramatic fashion every few years. This issue is the importance of ensuring that banking organizations maintain controls for their foreign affiliates that are sound and independent local management’s influence. History has shown that foreign affiliates are particularly vulnerable to internal control problems. The failure of Barings Bank and the losses incurred by institutions such as Daiwa Bank and, most recently, Allied Irish Bank were directly related to a failure in proper control of foreign affiliates. In most cases these losses could have been avoided by ensuring that the bank’s control procedures--for example, segregation of duties and the conduct of thorough and independent internal audits--were functioning properly. Even under a risk-focused approach, supervisors must ensure that bank management is providing adequate controls for all aspects of the business, even those that appear relatively minor in scope.
A number of banking organizations from developing countries have also had difficulties related to inadequate controls in recent years, particularly banks from countries with weak supervisory oversight. The difficulties have created significant losses for these banking organizations. The lessons from these cases for developing country supervision are that basic control functions are critical to all organizations, no matter what the size, and that banks operating overseas must be monitored carefully and continuously.
Related to these cases is the broader issue of implementing a rigorous supervisory structure for foreign banking organizations. We have seen in our markets that the increased competition produced by opening the banking sector to foreign institutions can enhance efficiency. For developing countries, the introduction of foreign competition is likely also to introduce a transfer of skills to the local banking community. Staff trained by foreign bankers often move to local institutions, and foreign bankers themselves have been involved in training local banking staff. For example, in the People’s Republic of China, a prominent U.S. banking organization has been providing training for staff and executives of state-owned, local banks--training the organization believes will benefit its business in the longer run by increasing the sophistication of the market as a whole.
Yet from the perspective of the home country supervisor, introducing an appropriate supervisory apparatus is important to monitor the activities of these banks and to enhance the host supervisor’s understanding of the global institution and supervisory framework in the home country market. The development of a clear supervisory framework for foreign banking organizations will improve the safety and soundness of the banking sector as a whole. And in addition, the supervision of foreign banking organizations may provide a training opportunity to host supervisors in developing countries, given the quality of information and risk management practices in many foreign banking organizations operating in their market.
Conclusion
The increasingly integrated nature of financial sectors around the world has increased the importance of sound banking supervision in all financial markets. The U.S. experience provides valuable lessons for the development of effective supervision in developing countries, but those lessons must be viewed within the institutional context of each market. The earlier stages of development in our system may hold the most important practices for developing countries. I wish you all the best in your very important work in this field and have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to speak with you today.'''

a_2002_34 = '''Over the past two decades we have witnessed a remarkable turnaround in the U.S. economy. The aftermath of the Vietnam War and a series of oil shocks had left the United States with high inflation, lackluster productivity growth, and a declining competitive position in international markets.
But rather than accept the role of a once-great, but diminishing economic force, for reasons that will doubtless be debated for years to come, we resurrected the dynamism of previous generations of Americans. A wave of innovation across a broad range of technologies, combined with considerable deregulation and a further lowering of barriers to trade, fostered a pronounced expansion of competition and creative destruction.
The result through the 1990s of all this seeming-heightened instability for individual businesses, somewhat surprisingly, was an apparent reduction in the volatility of output and in the frequency and amplitude of business cycles for the macroeconomy. While the empirical evidence on the importance of changes in the magnitude of the shocks impacting on our economy remains ambiguous, it does appear that shocks are more readily absorbed than in decades past. The massive drop in equity wealth over the past two years, the sharp decline in capital investment, and the tragic events of September 11 might reasonably have been expected to produce an immediate severe contraction in the U.S. economy. But this did not occur. Economic imbalances in recent years apparently have been addressed more expeditiously and effectively than in the past, aided importantly by the more widespread availability and more intensive use of real-time information.
But faster adjustments imply a greater volatility in expected corporate earnings. Although direct estimates of investors' expectations for earnings are not readily available, indirect evidence does seem to support an increased volatility in those expectations. Securities analysts' expectations for long-term earnings growth, an assumed proxy for investors' expectations, were revised up significantly over the second half of the 1990s and into 2000.1 Over that same period, risk spreads on corporate bonds rose markedly on net, implying a rising probability of default. Default, of course, is generally associated with negative earnings. Hence, higher average expected earnings growth coupled with a rising probability of default implies a greater variance of earnings expectations, a consequence of a lengthened negative tail. Consistent with a greater variability of earnings expectations, volatility of stock prices has been elevated in recent years.
The increased volatility of stock prices and the associated quickening of the adjustment process would also have been expected to be accompanied by less volatility in real economic variables. And that does appear to have been the case. That is, after all, the purpose of a prompter response by businesses: to prevent severe imbalances from developing at their firms, which in the aggregate can turn into deep contractions if unchecked.
As might be expected, accumulating signs of greater economic stability over the decade of the 1990s fostered an increased willingness on the part of business managers and investors to take risks with both positive and negative consequences. Stock prices rose in response to the greater propensity for risk-taking and to improved prospects for earnings growth that reflected emerging evidence of an increased pace of innovation. The associated decline in the cost of equity capital spurred a pronounced rise in capital investment and productivity growth that broadened impressively in the latter years of the 1990s. Stock prices rose further, responding to the growing optimism about greater stability, strengthening investment, and faster productivity growth.
But, as we indicated in congressional testimony in July 1999,2 "... productivity acceleration does not ensure that equity prices are not overextended. There can be little doubt that if the nation's productivity growth has stepped up, the level of profits and their future potential would be elevated. That prospect has supported higher stock prices. The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted, perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity prices to levels that are unsupportable even if risks in the future become relatively small. Such straying above fundamentals could create problems for our economy when the inevitable adjustment occurs."
Looking back on those years, it is evident that increased productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to price-earnings ratios. Between 1995 and 2000, the price-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 rose from 15 to nearly 30. However, to attribute that increase entirely to revised earnings expectations would require an upward revision to the growth of real earnings of 2 full percentage points in perpetuity.3
Because the real riskless rate of return apparently did not change much during that five-year period, anything short of such an extraordinary permanent increase in the growth of structural productivity, and thus earnings,4 implies a significant fall in real equity premiums in those years.
If all of the drop in equity premiums had resulted from a permanent reduction in cyclical volatility, stock prices arguably could have stabilized at their levels in the summer of 2000. That clearly did not happen, indicating that stock prices, in fact, had risen to levels in excess of any economically supportable base. Toward the end of that year, expectations for long-term earnings growth began to turn down. At about the same time, equity premiums apparently began to rise.
The consequent reversal in stock prices that has occurred over the past couple of years has been particularly pronounced in the high-tech sectors of the economy. The investment boom in the late 1990s, initially spurred by significant advances in information technology, ultimately produced an overhang of installed capacity. Even though demand for a number of high-tech products was doubling or tripling annually, in many cases new supply was coming on even faster. Overall, capacity in high-tech manufacturing industries rose more than 40 percent in 2000, well in excess of its rapid rate of increase over the previous two years. In light of the burgeoning supply, the pace of increased demand for the newer technologies, though rapid, fell short of that needed to sustain the elevated real rate of return for the whole of the high-tech capital stock. Returns on the securities of high-tech firms ultimately collapsed, as did capital investment. Similar, though less severe, adjustments were occurring in many industries across our economy.
Some decline in equity premiums in the latter part of the 1990s almost surely would have been anticipated as the continuing absence of any business correction reinforced notions of increased secular stability. In such an environment, the relatively mild recession that we experienced in 2001 might still have been expected to leave equity premiums below their long-term averages. That apparently has not been the case, as the tendency toward lower equity premiums created by a more stable economy may have been offset to some extent recently by concerns about the quality of corporate governance.
* * *
The struggle to understand developments in the economy and financial markets since the mid-1990s has been particularly challenging for monetary policymakers. We were confronted with forces that none of us had personally experienced. Aside from the then recent experience of Japan, only history books and musty archives gave us clues to the appropriate stance for policy. We at the Federal Reserve considered a number of issues related to asset bubbles--that is, surges in prices of assets to unsustainable levels. As events evolved, we recognized that, despite our suspicions, it was very difficult to definitively identify a bubble until after the fact--that is, when its bursting confirmed its existence.
Moreover, it was far from obvious that bubbles, even if identified early, could be preempted short of the central bank inducing a substantial contraction in economic activity--the very outcome we would be seeking to avoid.
Prolonged periods of expansion promote a greater rational willingness to take risks, a pattern very difficult to avert by a modest tightening of monetary policy. In fact, our experience over the past fifteen years suggests that monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without depressing economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices.
For example, stock prices rose following the completion of the more than 300-basis-point rise in the federal funds rate in the twelve months ending in February 1989. And during the year beginning in February 1994, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds target 300 basis points. Stock prices initially flattened, but as soon as that round of tightening was completed, they resumed their marked upward advance. From mid-1999 through May 2000, the federal funds rate was raised 150 basis points. However, equity price increases were largely undeterred during that period despite what now, in retrospect, was the exhausted tail of a bull market.5
Such data suggest that nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble. The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have been calibrated to prevent the late 1990s bubble is almost surely an illusion.
Instead, we noted in the previously cited mid-1999 congressional testimony the need to focus on policies "to mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the transition to the next expansion."
* * *
It seems reasonable to generalize from our recent experience that no low-risk, low-cost, incremental monetary tightening exists that can reliably deflate a bubble. But is there some policy that can at least limit the size of a bubble and, hence, its destructive fallout? From the evidence to date, the answer appears to be no.6 But we do need to know more about the behavior of equity premiums and bubbles and their impact on economic activity.7
The equity premium, computed as the total expected return on common stocks less that on riskless debt, prices the risk taken by investors in purchasing equities rather than risk-free debt. It is a measure largely of the risk aversion of investors, not that of corporate managers. An increased appetite for risk by investors, for example, is manifested by a shift in their willingness to hold equity in place of psychologically less-stressful, but lower-yielding, debt.
In this case, the cost of equity confronting corporate managers falls relative to the cost of debt. With greater access to lower-cost equity, managers are able to finance a higher proportion of riskier real assets with a lessened call on cash flow and fear of default.
Thus, it is generally the changing risk preferences of investors, not of corporate managers, that govern the mix of risk investment in an economy. Managers presumably employ market prices of debt and equity coupled with the calculated rate of return on particular real investment projects to determine the level of corporate investment. To be sure, managers' personal sense of risk aversion can sometimes influence the capital investment process, but it is probably a secondary effect relative to the vagaries of investor psychology.
Bubbles thus appear to primarily reflect exuberance on the part of investors in pricing financial assets. If managers and investors perceived the same degree of risk, and both correctly judged a sustainable rise in profits stemming from new technology, for example, none of a rise in stock prices would reflect a bubble. Bubbles appear to emerge when investors either overestimate the sustainable rise in profits or unrealistically lower the rate of discount they apply to expected profits and dividends. The distinction cannot readily be ascertained from market prices. But the equity premium less the expected growth of dividends, and presumed earnings, can be estimated as the dividend yield less the real long-term interest rate on U.S. Treasuries.8
If equity premiums were redefined to include both the unrealistic part of profit projections and the unsustainably low segment of discount factors, and if we had associated measures of these concepts, we could employ this measure to infer emerging bubbles. That is, if we could substitute realistic projections of earnings and dividend growth, perhaps based on structural productivity growth and the behavior of the payout ratio, the residual equity premium might afford some evidence of a developing bubble. Of course, if the central bank had access to this information, so would private agents, rendering the development of bubbles highly unlikely.
Bubbles are often precipitated by perceptions of real improvements in the productivity and underlying profitability of the corporate economy. But as history attests, investors then too often exaggerate the extent of the improvement in economic fundamentals. Human psychology being what it is, bubbles tend to feed on themselves, and booms in their later stages are often supported by implausible projections of potential demand. Stock prices and equity premiums are then driven to unsustainable levels.
Certainly, a bubble cannot persist indefinitely. Eventually, unrealistic expectations of future earnings will be proven wrong. As this happens, asset prices will gravitate back to levels that are in line with a sustainable path for earnings. The continual pressing of reality on perception inevitably disciplines the views of both investors and managers.
As I noted earlier, the key policy question is: If low-cost, incremental policy tightening appears incapable of deflating bubbles, do other options exist that can at least effectively limit the size of bubbles without doing substantial damage in the process? To date, we have not been able to identify such policies, though perhaps we or others may do so in the future.
It is by no means evident to us that we currently have--or will be able to find--a measure of equity premiums or related indicators that convincingly presage an emerging bubble. Short of such a measure, I find it difficult to conceive of an adequate degree of central bank certainty to justify the scale of preemptive tightening that would likely be necessary to neutralize a bubble.
As we delve deeper into the questions raised by the developments of recent years, the interplay between structural productivity growth and equity premiums, so evident during the past business cycle, is bound to play a prominent role. We need particularly to determine whether the periodic emergence of market bubbles, which have occurred so often in the past, is inevitable going forward. As financial wealth becomes an ever-more-important determinant of activity, we need also to understand far better how changing equity premiums affect and reflect real and financial investment decisions. If the equity premium has so demonstrable an influence on our economies as it appears to have, the value of further investigation of this topic is evident.
* * *
In conclusion, the endeavors of policymakers to stabilize our economies require a functioning model of the way our economies work. Increasingly, it appears that this model needs to embody movements in equity premiums and the development of bubbles if it is to explain history.
Any useful model needs to credibly simulate counterfactual alternatives. We must remember that structural models that do a poor job of explaining history presumably also will provide an incomplete basis for policymaking. Often the internal structure of such models has been employed to evaluate the effect of various stabilization policies. But the results from models whose internal structure cannot successfully replicate key features of cyclical behavior must be interpreted carefully. The recent importance of movements in equity premiums and asset bubbles suggests the need to better understand and integrate these concepts into the models used for policy analysis.
I anticipate productive discussion of these and other issues related to stabilization policy over the next couple of days.'''

a_2002_55 = '''I am delighted that my long-time friend, Ron Tate, invited me to participate in the Forum Series of the School of Business and Industry at Florida A&M University. In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on the economy and on the business environment that many of you will soon enter. In doing so, I will be drawing on my experience most recently as an economic policymaker and, before that, in business and banking. The views I will be expressing are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. First, I will touch briefly on the current economic situation and on why, despite the weak pace of economic activity in 2001, I see the longer-run outlook for the U.S. economy as quite favorable. Then I would like to discuss the evolution of the labor market over the past few decades and its implications for someone about to embark on a career. In doing so, I will attempt to identify the challenges that changes in the work environment pose for new entrants to the workforce, and will offer my perspectives on how you might best meet those challenges.
As you undoubtedly know, the National Bureau of Economic Research has determined that the U.S. economy entered a recession about one year ago, a downturn that ended an unprecedented period of economic expansion. That remarkable expansion was notable not only for its duration but also for its rapid advances in technology, which fueled a surge in business capital spending, an acceleration in productivity, and rapid gains in real income and wealth. However, when demand began to slow in late 2000, businesses were faced with uncomfortably high levels of inventories, an oversupply of capital goods, and declining profits. As a result, businesses made the usual adjustments to these conditions. They cut production, slashed inventories, reduced capital spending, and laid off workers. That adjustment process was subsequently exacerbated by the events of September 11.
I am sure that all of you remember the uncertainty and shock of the period immediately after September 11, when our economy came briefly to a near standstill. Surprisingly, in light of that experience, the latest recession has turned out to be quite mild by the standards of the past thirty years. Current estimates indicate that real GDP was about flat during the last three quarters of 2001, in contrast with the average decline of 2-1/2 percent posted in the deeper recessions of 1973-75, 1981-82, and 1990-91. The better performance this time around has come in large part from the solid pace of household spending over the past year. Buoyed by low interest rates, falling energy prices, and tax cuts, home sales last year remained near a record high, motor vehicle sales peaked at their highest level ever, and overall real personal consumption expenditures increased about 3 percent, a rate well below the pace of the previous few years but still very respectable given the uncertainty of the times.
A more important fact for the longer-run outlook is that, in comparison with the start of other recessions since the mid-1970s, the economy entered the recent slowdown with a much lower rate of inflation and a noticeably higher rate of increase in productivity. One favorable consequence of the subdued rate of inflation last year was that monetary policy was able to move aggressively to limit the extent of the downturn.
Productivity growth during the recession has been even more strikingly out of character for a standard business cycle. Typically, a cyclical downturn in business activity leads to declines in or, at best, very anemic gains in labor productivity as firms struggle to adjust to declining demand and less efficient operating rates. However, by current estimates, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at a stunning annual rate of about 2-3/4 percent during the last three quarters of 2001--a pace equal to that which businesses were able to achieve over the previous three years of rapid economic expansion. That the recession does not appear to have much dented the rate of growth in productivity supports the view that the step-up in such growth that emerged in the mid-1990s resulted not only from the rapid expansion of real output but also from a more lasting shift in the structural trend rate of increase.
The fundamental change in the pace of labor productivity seems to confirm what businesses were telling us--that they had used a wide range of technological advances and managerial innovations to improve their supply-chain management and information systems and to better tailor their products and services to meet customer demands. That is important because faster productivity growth is the crucial determinant of how quickly we can raise our nation's real standard of living. Productivity improvement has a bit of the same flavor as compound interest: For one year the number does not seem large. Only when considered over a period of years does it become dramatic. If productivity increases 1-1/2 percent per year on average, our standard of living will double about every forty-six years--or about every two generations. But if productivity rises 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every twenty-three years--or about every generation.
Of course, while I can point to some favorable aspects of our economic performance during the recession, I also recognize that this recession, like the others before it, diminished job opportunities. Between the business cycle peak last March and this past January, employers shed almost 1-1/2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate rose more than 1 percentage point, to 5.6 percent, its highest level since mid-1995. Although the unemployment rate is still well below the peak rates reached in any recession since 1948, the comparison may be small comfort to those of you who are about to enter the labor market. Job opportunities in the current economic environment are obviously less favorable than what we enjoyed in the late 1990s.
As is frequently the case when the economy is transitioning from contraction to expansion, uncertainty about the strength of the recovery is considerable. However, I am optimistic that, with the adjustments to production and inventories now largely behind us, the longer-run trends in productivity and output will begin to reassert themselves. And, while job prospects in the very near term may not turn out to be especially favorable, opportunities for building a successful long-term career in today's economy should, over time, be plentiful. Simply put, I believe that the next few years will prove to be a very good time to be a young person looking for interesting and challenging opportunities in business. But I would caution you that, even in a prosperous economy, individuals' success varies considerably. Thus, today's entrants to the workforce need to ask themselves how they can take maximum advantage of the opportunities they encounter.
As I shift, here, from my perspective as an economic policymaker to my perspective as an observer of job-market and business-practice trends, I would like to describe some of the important changes that I have witnessed over the past several decades.
To an economist, the clearest evidence of significant changes in the labor market during the 1980s and 1990s is the gap that opened between higher-paid workers and lower-paid workers. Most of that increase has resulted from exceptionally rapid gains in earnings for those in the upper half of the wage distribution, but you may be surprised to learn that it also represents a greater dispersion of outcomes for those with similar job titles and levels of education. This is a striking difference from other times--like those when Ron and I graduated from college. Let me repeat it with additional emphasis: Any two of you can enter the labor force with similar education backgrounds, and accept jobs that appear to be very much alike, but end up with a wide disparity in take-home pay.
This issue is, I admit, complex, so let me first go over it in economic terms before adding some real-world observations. In broad terms, an important contributor to the rise in earnings inequality has been an increase in the premiums that firms are willing to pay for higher-level skills. For example, using education as one very rough measure of skill and using median usual weekly earnings as a wage measure, we can calculate a college wage premium as the ratio of wages for college-educated workers to wages for those with a high-school education. In 1979, that premium was about 40 percent; by the mid-1990s, it had increased to about 75 percent, and it has remained at that level since. Cutting the wage data another way, we find that even within the college-educated group, the ratio of median earnings of those at the 90th percentile of the college wage distribution to those at the 10th percentile has increased from 3.4 to 4.1 during the same period.
Employers' needs for skills are often just associated with the capability to use new technologies, and one might assume that the forces driving the dispersion in pay would be strongest for jobs in information technology. But the skill premium is broader than that. Even among college graduates and among those with graduate degrees, employers are ready to pay a premium for managers who have the creativity and conceptual ability to apply their training and technological expertise to business lines in non-tech fields. For example, a recent study using detailed information on managerial pay structures within thirty-nine large companies found that the dispersion of compensation paid to managers within individual firms had increased because of differential rewards to those with higher levels of know-how, problem-solving skills, and accountability.1
Over the past twenty-five years, I have seen striking advances in information technology sweep through the financial services industry, and I have consulted with individuals in a broad range of other industries who report radical changes in how businesses operate--changes in production techniques, inventory management, distribution, sales, and marketing. Businesses have seen the scope of their products and services expand, and they are reaching a broader range of customers. And the changes have led these organizations to more highly value the managers and others who have the ability to understand and take advantage of the efficiencies offered by the new technologies.
These changes, in turn, have led firms to reconfigure the way they advance and reward their employees. In particular, twenty-five years ago, the career path in many businesses looked much more predictable than it does today. A group of managers, for instance, would be hired by a firm in a particular year. These managers would tend to move up the management ladder together--usually promoted on the basis of seniority. In the process, they typically would accumulate broad experiences in a number of business areas within the organization, and a significant percentage would stay with their first employer for an entire career. In contrast, in today's work place, individuals gain responsibilities and become specialists much faster. Individuals with similar tenure may be promoted at much different rates, and, as suggested by the statistics showing rising earnings inequality within groups with similar education and experience, salary differentiation among employees is likely to be more pronounced than it used to be. Predictably, the person who stays with a single employer for an entire career is increasingly rare.
Underlying this change in labor markets is the increasingly competitive environment in which firms find themselves. Given deregulation, global competition, and the resultant limits on pricing power in many industries, businesses are focusing more on the "bottom line" and are more aggressively searching for ways to improve their efficiency and profitability. They are asking what each unit within the company is contributing to the value of the firm. Many executives are increasingly interested in measuring the performance of individual units through the use of advanced accounting techniques--economic value-added systems being one example that has received a great deal of attention. Firms for which intangibles--brands, patents, software, research programs, and the like--are an important component of value have moved toward integrating, or at least producing, intellectual capital accounts in addition to the usual financial balance sheets.
One result of this greater emphasis on firm value is that the work culture has become much more performance-based than it was twenty-five years ago. At the business-unit level, sales and marketing groups have had to become more responsive to the needs of their customers. Project life cycles are shorter now than in the past as firms aim to foster flexibility to keep up with the demand for new products. Businesses are looking for employees capable of expanding markets for their products and services or of developing innovative ways to reduce costs. They want to measure what their workers contribute to the value of the firm, and they are increasingly willing to reward their workers according to these contributions.
Thus, as I noted above, firms have made their pay systems much more flexible and now routinely use merit-pay systems that base salary increases and promotions on performance. In addition, firms have increased their use of variable pay or have raised the potential value of bonus systems already in place. The most striking example of the expanded use of variable pay has been the sharp rise in stock-option grants in recent years. According to one survey, the number of U.S. corporations with employee stock ownership plans rose from just 200 in 1974 to roughly 10,000 in 1998. More important, these stock options are no longer limited to the top executives in a company. According to a recent KPMG survey of 133 companies, 72 percent of middle managers, 35 percent of all union-exempt employees, and 12 percent of nonexempt employees were eligible to receive stock option awards. Of course, as those whose options fell out of the money well know, stock options do not automatically translate into higher income. But for many, stock options paid off handsomely during the late 1990s. More than 50 percent of adults in the United States now participate in some form of stock ownership in large part because of participation in either stock option programs or retirement plans that invest in stocks.
Another change in recent years is the greater tendency of firms to reconfigure work arrangements, both to increase their ability to adjust labor inputs and as a way to reward valuable employees. The most obvious examples are the increased reliance by many firms on temporary-help workers and contract employees. Both provide businesses with greater flexibility to alter the size of their workforces. But even for permanent employees, the employment relation between the firm and its workers has changed significantly.
The rise in the use of less-traditional conditions of employment is one clear example of this. In particular, highly valued employees now have greater power to negotiate customized work arrangements suited to their own preferences. Such arrangements might include telecommuting, flexible hours, developmental leave, and a variety of other possibilities. Again, the underlying rationale for the firm is to provide a way to reward workers for good performance.
While offering more flexible work environments and performance rewards, employers also have raised their expectations about their employees' willingness to develop their own individual capabilities. Workers today are pressed to invest in skill development and to seek new opportunities and experiences that will increase their value to the company. Employees can no longer rely on what they learned in school to suffice for their entire careers. Rather, today's workers are expected to accumulate an ever-expanding range of skills over their working lives--both on-the-job and through additional training. The real value of the formal education that you are now receiving is that, with it, you will be able to enter jobs in which you very likely will be challenged to learn more, to try new assignments, and to take some risks.
One of the exciting--and admittedly unsettling--aspects of the economy in recent years is that we cannot predict exactly where technical change will take us, even in the fairly near term. That is, we cannot forecast what our business practices and products will look like only a decade ahead--over a period of time, say, in which your careers will have just begun. I have witnessed such a transformation as technological change has swept through the banking and financial services industries over the past ten years, and I have been a more-distant observer of the process in many other exciting areas--biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, to name just a few.
In sum, I will offer this advice as you make the transition from your university training to business. First, take with you not simply your BA or MBA but also a willingness to be flexible, a keen eye for new opportunities to increase your value on the job, and an appetite for lifelong learning. Second, leave here knowing your current strengths and what you enjoy, but be open to change. As those strengths and preferences are tested on the job, you should be looking for opportunities that kindle your creative spark and, as a consequence, give you great satisfaction. And if that process leads you in a different direction, do not be afraid to change course and follow it.'''

a_2002_74 = '''It's a pleasure to participate in your annual summit on economic development. Given the nature of the conference, I would like to focus on a matter of mutual interest--improvements in asset accumulation in traditionally underserved markets of our household and business sectors and the importance of access to the financing and information tools that promote and sustain this progress.

In our economy, the three principal means for household asset accumulation are through home ownership, small business ownership, and savings. As important as these are for the individual, they also represent distinct and important benefits to the broader economy and, therefore, play prominent roles in the operation of our financial markets and the priorities of our public policy.

The choice to buy a home is a decision to plant a family's roots in a community with all the implicit incentives to make that community thrive. Where home ownership flourishes, it is no surprise to find increased neighborhood stability, more civic-minded residents, better school systems, and reduced crime rates.

Just as important is the effect of home ownership on a household's ability to accumulate assets. For most households, home ownership represents a significant financial milestone and is an important vehicle for ongoing savings. The Federal Reserve's 1998 triennial Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that home ownership represented 44 percent of gross assets for families earning $50,000 or less annually. Further, investment in residential property has been generally more stable than other types of investment, and it is perceived to be largely permanent.

With these important benefits, an increased rate of home ownership has been chosen by our society as a national priority, with many public- and private-sector resources devoted to achieving this goal. Indeed, measurable progress has been made toward this end, with the overall rate of home ownership reaching 68 percent, a new high, in the third quarter of last year. In assessing the opportunity for home ownership in underserved markets, the Census Bureau reports significant gains. The homeownership rate for blacks and Hispanics, between 1997 and 2001, grew at more than double the pace for the general population. Additionally, the homeownership rate among households earning less than the median income increased more than three times the pace for households with incomes above the median.

Small business accounts for about half of private gross domestic product in our economy. It is an important vehicle for significant numbers of minority families to accumulate assets.

Recently released data from the Census Bureau, for example, indicate that, between 1992 and 1997, the number of minority-owned businesses grew more than four times as fast as the number of U.S. firms overall, increasing from 2.1 million to about 2.8 million. In addition, the Census Bureau estimates that during this five-year period the number of women-owned businesses increased 16 percent, to 5.4 million enterprises.

These data suggest that the increases in small business ownership and equity investment by traditionally underserved populations result, in part, from increased access to appropriate financing to fund the start-up and growth of businesses. It is essential that the opportunity to start an enterprise is open to anyone with a viable business concept. We must continue to seek ways to promote the creation and expansion of viable firms by lowering barriers to funding and financial services.

To the extent that market participants discriminate--consciously or, more insidiously, unconsciously--capital does not flow to its most profitable uses, and the distribution of output is distorted. In the end, costs are higher, less real output is produced, and national wealth accumulation is slowed. By removing the non-economic distortions that arise as a result of discrimination, we can generate higher returns to human capital and other productive resources. Investors and lenders need to understand that failure to recognize the profitable opportunities represented by minority enterprises not only harms these firms, it harms the lending institutions as well. Accordingly, we must make further progress in establishing business relationships between the financial services sector and the rapidly growing number of minority- and women-owned businesses.

Doing so is crucial since pursuing the obviously worthwhile goal of increasing home ownership in minority communities also increases the debt of homeowners in these communities. Debt cannot indefinitely be pyramided against home equity as the principal or sole asset. Developing non-home equity, largely through small-business ownership, not only enhances home ownership among business owners in minority communities, it more importantly offers a source of risk capital to budding entrepreneurs in that community.

Household saving, of course, is a fundamental component for increasing financial capacity and serves as a starting point for the accumulation of future tangible assets, such as homes and businesses. It is also a source of funding for education, which can materially improve future earning capacity. In the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances, the top three reasons for saving given by respondents were retirement, liquidity, and education. These survey data, once again, exhibit positive trends among lower-income and minority populations.

Some progress is being made regarding the ownership of financial assets by families in the bottom quintile of net worth and by those who are nonwhite or Hispanic. In addition, survey respondents in these two categories experienced the largest increases in the ownership of transaction accounts, an important indicator of financial progress because the accounts often serve as the point of entry into the financial services industry. Despite these gains, however, lower-income and minority families continue to represent a large fraction of families that do not possess a checking account or, for that matter, other assets.

Sparse holdings of financial assets may, in part, be due to lack of access to savings vehicles such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k) retirement plans. Recognizing this possible link, community organizations have collaborated with their partners in government and the private sector to design innovative mechanisms for saving. One such vehicle is the individual development account, which state and federal government agencies have embraced as a means for facilitating saving for low-income households. Through tax benefits and matching funds, this instrument helps individuals earmark funds to achieve longer-term financial goals, such as purchasing a home, starting a business, or pursuing higher education or job training. Besides providing a structured account that offers a high incentive to save, individual development account programs require participation in financial training to help individuals continue on the path of economic betterment.

Structural changes in the financial services industry, in recent years, have heightened competition, encouraging market efficiencies that continue to help drive down costs and to foster the emergence of increasingly diverse and highly specialized organizations. These organizations--which range from firms that offer their services through electronic delivery mechanisms to local partnerships that provide one-on-one counseling and financing arrangements--provide consumers with increased access to various credit and savings instruments.

Community-based organizations have contributed in this evolving marketplace by helping to ensure that traditionally underserved populations and geographic areas are able to achieve gains in asset accumulation. And, as in the broader economy, market-driven innovation has advanced community development, enabling community-based organizations to more effectively respond to the needs of the communities and families they serve. Community development organizations working in partnership with financial corporations and governments have created new intermediaries--community development corporations, micro-business loan funds, and multibank and investor loan pools, among them--to provide financial opportunity for lower-income individuals and families. These innovators have succeeded in developing new approaches for engaging disadvantaged participants in the economy in the same manner that any successful organization does--by assessing need, evaluating risks, managing costs, and developing appropriate products.

Educational and training programs may be the most critical service offered by community-based organizations to enhance the ability of lower-income households to accumulate assets. Indeed, analysts have shown that a comprehensive understanding of basic principles of budgeting and saving, at the start, increases household wealth in later years.

Education can also increase economic opportunity by enabling individuals to overcome their reluctance or inability to take full advantage of technological advances and product innovation. As market forces continue to expand the range of financial services, consumers will have more choice and flexibility in how they manage their finances, and they will seek instruction in the use of the new technologies to help formulate better decisions. Financial education can equip consumers with the fundamental knowledge required to choose among the myriad of products and providers in the financial services industry. It can also help to inculcate individuals with the financial knowledge necessary to create household budgets, initiate savings plans, and make strategic investment decisions. Such financial planning can help families meet near-term obligations and maximize their longer-term well being and is especially valuable for populations that have traditionally been underserved by our financial system.

Community-based organizations have an integral role in disseminating information that can assist lower-income families in exploiting financial opportunity. Because of their local focus, these organizations can develop educational and training programs tailored to the markets they serve. Through homeownership counseling programs, they offer families information that is fundamental to obtaining and maintaining mortgage credit. (A recent study conducted by one of the leading purchasers of home mortgages found that homeownership counseling can effectively reduce delinquency rates by as much as a third.) Community organizations are also using financial literacy campaigns to help prevent vulnerable consumers from becoming entangled in financially devastating credit arrangements. The campaigns are important in addressing abusive lending practices that target specific neighborhoods or vulnerable segments of the population and can result in unaffordable payments, equity stripping, and foreclosure.

Similarly, training programs for microenterprise development provide information on the fundamentals of starting a business, such as developing a business plan and financial statements, that allow lenders and investors to evaluate risk.

Community groups are not alone in the effort to provide life-long financial education. Some school systems have introduced financial management curricula, and some employers have taken up the challenge. At the Federal Reserve Board, for example, our Consumer and Community Affairs staff recently hosted several well-attended educational programs for Federal Reserve employees, providing information on qualifying for a mortgage and managing debt. The Community Affairs and Public Information offices at the twelve Federal Reserve Banks also have joined together, with the strong support of Governor Gramlich, to promote both local and national financial literacy and economic education programs.

The Community Affairs Offices help financial institutions, community organizations, and local governments increase economic opportunity in distressed neighborhoods through strategic partnerships. The offices provide information on innovative funding strategies for community economic development. And they seek new ways of measuring the effectiveness of financial literacy programs. In our call for papers for the Community Affairs Research Conference scheduled for the spring of 2003, we have asked for studies that evaluate the effect of such education initiatives. Measurement of the quality and long-term success of these efforts will be particularly useful to the Federal Reserve System as we develop and distribute financial and economic literacy products.

In conclusion, I encourage community groups such as those represented here to continue productive partnerships and activities that have yielded much progress in increasing the assets of their constituencies. With your continued commitment and market-driven product innovation, the prospect for increased economic opportunity for traditionally underserved markets remains promising.'''

data.at[383,'speech'] = a_2002_74

a_2001_5 = '''To promote macroeconomic stability, monetary policy must respond to changing economic conditions. On that premise, I always start my thinking about monetary policy by identifying what I like to call the outlook context. Is inflation likely to be stable, or will it rise or fall? Is the economy losing momentum rapidly or will it likely grow at or above trend?
The outlook context today must include both the state of the economy before September 11 and the implications of the events of September 11. At this point, of course, it is impossible to fully disentangle the contributions of the pre-September 11 momentum and the post-September 11 impact. Moreover, neither contribution is crystal clear--especially the latter, for which we have only early data. Conceptually, however, assessing economic prospects today requires us to blend the two considerations.
Then I will turn to the challenges policymakers face as a result of the complex forces identified in the outlook context. Here I will address three questions: Has monetary policy been less effective recently compared with earlier periods of aggressive easing to counter sharply slower growth or the onset of recession? What are the implications of facing a significant adverse shock at an already-low nominal federal funds rate? What is the appropriate relationship between monetary and fiscal policies, in general and today?
Let me remind you, before I proceed further, that my remarks today reflect my own views of the outlook and challenges facing monetary policy. I am not speaking for the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors.
Challenges Facing the Fed Immediately after the Events of September 11
Before I turn to the outlook and the challenges faced by monetary policymakers, I want to discuss the Federal Reserve's reaction to the disruption of financial transactions and the increased demand for liquidity and bank lending that resulted from the events of September 11. When we think of September 11, we will always, first and foremost, remember the thousands whose lives were lost or were irreparably harmed--the personal tragedies. Immediately after the attacks, many others worked hard to restore a normal course of business, essential to avoid compounding the personal tragedies with economic dislocations. Doing so was especially a challenge for those involved in the financial services industry. The area in New York City hit by the attacks--including the two World Trade Center towers--housed many financial firms and constituted an important part of the infrastructure of financial markets. The events of that day could have disrupted those markets and the activity that they financed for a considerable time.
Instead, we learned once again that the financial sector is enormously resilient. In many cases, people needed only a cubicle and a computer to return to work. In contrast, restarting an airplane factory or an auto factory if its production had been disrupted would have taken an extremely long time. Such resumption of business by financial firms depended on careful planning in advance, on backup data, on software, and so forth. To be sure, securities markets and transactions, particularly the clearing and settlement in the government securities markets, were disrupted for a period. But financial markets and firms adapted and responded, contributing to the quick resumption of normal business.
The Fed, too, had many challenges at that time. One was that Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson was the only Board member in Washington D.C. on September 11. The Chairman was in Basel, I was in Beijing, and the two other Governors were elsewhere in the United States. This didn't diminish the ability of the Federal Reserve System to respond quickly and effectively. The Vice Chairman, together with the Reserve Bank presidents and staff members at the Board and the Reserve Banks, did a superb job.
We wore many hats on that day and the days immediately following. First, we acted as the provider of liquidity. Normal channels of borrowing and payments were disrupted. Some banks that were counting on receiving funds had to rely on the Federal Reserve instead. Security firms and businesses impeded in their usual borrowing turned to the banks, and, for primary dealer firms, to Federal Reserve open market operations, increasing the need for extra Federal Reserve liquidity.
The Vice Chairman issued a brief statement immediately after the attack that signaled the Fed's readiness to supply liquidity as needed: "The Federal Reserve is open and the discount window is available for meeting liquidity needs." We used every existing vehicle for injecting liquidity and even invented a new one--the use of large swap lines with foreign central banks to inject dollar liquidity. Discount window loans soared instantly from around $200 million to a peak of about $45 billion on September 12 and later, as markets began to function better, Federal Reserve repurchase agreements soared from $25 billion to nearly $100 billion. Second, we used monetary policy to counter what was sure to be a sharp adverse shock to demand and to bolster confidence that the Fed would do what was necessary to support the economy.
As supervisors, we and our sister banking agencies asked banks to work with their customers to meet legitimate credit needs. We benefited from our diverse financial system--one in which a strong banking system complements a dynamic capital market. When one is ailing, the other will often be--and in this case was--ready to take up the slack. And the banking system did its part admirably. We surveyed banks about whether they were limiting the drawdowns on pre-existing lines of credit. They informed us they were not. And we sought to understand the exposure of the banking system to the industries most immediately affected, such as airlines, insurance, travel, entertainment, and lodging.
We also had to focus on our own operational responsibilities, ensuring the continuation of vital payment services, including electronic transfers and check clearing. Finally, we had to work with market players to resolve clearance and settlement disruptions as a result of damage to telephone and other physical infrastructure. We were in touch with the banks and other participants in financial markets, we were in touch with the other banking and security regulators, and we were in touch with each other within the Federal Reserve System.
The Fed and other banking and financial supervisors have received much praise for their quick and effective response. Though pleased with our ability to cope, we recognize that the country now faces contingencies for which no one specifically planned. So, like many other organizations, we are looking for lessons to be learned and actions to be taken.
The Outlook Context
Of course, coping with the implications of the terrorist attacks for our financial infrastructure has been only a part of the difficult job we faced in recent weeks. Assessing the condition of the economy and the appropriate course for monetary policy have remained central concerns at the Fed. The outlook today is a complicated mixture of the momentum and forces at work before September 11 and the new set of forces as a result of the events of that day.
Forecasters today often begin by almost apologizing for even offering a point forecast of economic activity over the coming year, given the prevailing uncertainties. But we all have our jobs to do, including forecasters. Forecasters can offer us a careful assessment of the forces at work and some plausible scenarios of how they may interact. Policymakers have to begin with a best guess about the outlook to guide their policy response.
The uncertainties we face today reflect at least three considerations. First, we were still struggling to understand the severity of the slowdown and the prospects for recovery before September 11. Second, the effects of September 11 depend, to a major degree, on the psychological influences on households and businesses. I am often asked, by the way, whether I believe that the economy drives psychology or psychology drives the economy. I always respond that I believe the economy drives psychology; and that, if I believed the reverse, I would have become a psychologist. I will return to the role of psychology in a minute, and even admit its potentially important role in shaping the near-term prospects. The third consideration is that unexpected events--from additional terrorist incidents at home to how well the war on terrorism is going abroad--may be especially important in shaping the outlook.
The State of the Economy before September 11
We need to integrate two aspects of the state of the economy before September 11 into the current outlook. First, and perhaps most obvious, is the momentum of the economy and specifically how close the economy was to a rebound. Second, the strength of the rebound will ultimately depend importantly on the pace of underlying productivity growth and hence the average rate of growth possible once the economy reaches full employment.
Momentum before September 11. At least two schools of thought about the economy's momentum existed just before September 11. Some believed that economic expansion would resume within a quarter or two, while others foresaw a more protracted period of weakness. Though I viewed economic growth as perhaps bottoming out after slowing to a near-zero rate in the second and third quarters, I expected growth to build only slowly and therefore expected the pace of recovery through the first half of 2002 to be disappointing.
To understand the sharpness of the slowdown that still gripped the economy at the time, we have to begin with the period of exceptional performance in the second half of the 1990s. Many interpreted this experience as suggesting that old rules no longer applied and, as a result, discounted long-standing regularities between resource utilization rates and inflation and worried less about limits to sustainable growth. I was not inclined to this view. To be sure, higher productivity growth was likely for a considerable period. But the initial adjustment to the acceleration in productivity also brought temporary bonuses that were not likely to persist over the longer run. They took the form of a temporary spurt in demand growth--pushing the unemployment rate progressively lower--and a temporary disinflationary impetus, preventing the increased utilization rates from immediately raising inflation. The persistent above-trend growth and progressive increase in utilization rates suggested to me a danger of overheating and higher inflation. This concern encouraged a series of tightening moves in an attempt to slow economic growth at least toward the new higher trend and thereby prevent still higher utilization rates. In my view, a period of below-trend growth was likely to be required to unwind what I viewed as an unsustainably high rate of resource utilization.
As a result of a coincidence of forces, the economy slowed much more steeply than the Fed expected or intended. Besides the effect of monetary policy, a sizable rise in energy prices over 1999 and 2000 and into early 2001 contributed to an erosion of aggregate demand. But most important was the shock that hit the economy in late 2000 and early 2001--a reassessment of the profitability of producing and owning high-tech equipment. This shock was manifest in both the financial markets and in the real economy. It resulted in a sharp correction in equity prices in the technology sector--the bursting of the technology bubble--and, at the same time, it led to a sharp retrenchment in the demand for and production of high-tech equipment. The economy slowed to the point where real GDP was nearly flat in the second quarter of this year and likely would have been nearly flat in the third quarter, even without the events of September 11.
The pre-September 11 prospects for recovery reflected the cumulative easing by the Fed, a sizable fiscal stimulus already in train, declining energy prices, and the normal internal dynamics that contribute to recoveries. I will return to these prospects for recovery in a moment.
Long-term growth prospects. The strength of the rebound expected before September 11 also was being shaped by the underlying pace of productivity growth. Recent revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts and other data, as well as the sharpness of the retrenchment in high-tech investment, had forced a reassessment of the prospects for longer-term productivity growth. The revisions suggested that, while that performance was still impressive, it was less exceptional than it had appeared before the revisions. In particular, the revisions had lowered the rate of productivity growth from 1998 through 2000 and, as a result, trimmed most estimates of the sustainable rate of economic growth going forward.
Before the annual NIPA revisions earlier this year, many had revised their forecasts of underlying productivity growth progressively upward to near 3 percent or even slightly higher, compared with the 1-1/2 percent rate achieved during the twenty-five years before the mid-1990s. The revisions suggested that underlying or structural productivity growth peaked at closer to 2-1/2 percent--still a remarkable improvement over the pre-1995 average but not quite as spectacular as many had thought. In addition, some of the earlier productivity growth, reflecting the frenzied pace of investment in high-tech equipment, now appears to have been unsustainable.1 Consensus estimates of longer-term productivity growth were revised downward to a range of 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent.
The Effects of September 11
In thinking about the effects of the September 11 events, I find focusing on three subperiods to be useful. The first subperiod includes the third and fourth quarters and perhaps the first quarter of next year. The second is the remainder of a typical monetary policy forecast period, in this case through 2003. And the third is the longer run, beyond 2003.
The near-term effects. The near-term effects are dominated by the disruption to certain industries--airlines, in particular, but also other travel-related industries such as hotels, entertainment, and tourism--and the psychological effects on households and businesses. Policymakers can do very little over this timeframe to affect the outcome, other than to bolster consumer and business confidence by what they do and say.
We have a variety of measures of consumer sentiment. In normal times, these measures, in my view, offer relatively little predictive power for household spending. That is because the economy usually drives psychology and mostly not the other way around. As a result, we can predict consumer confidence with the same variables we use to predict household spending. Measures of consumer confidence have relatively little incremental value in explaining consumer spending in such periods.
During the Gulf War, however, we learned, if we did not already know, that in extraordinary times consumer confidence can change abruptly in a way not foreshadowed by the incoming economic indicators. Another way of saying this is that sometimes the equations we use to predict consumer confidence make dramatic forecast errors. Such errors may indicate an "exogenous" psychological shock and thus provide additional information to forecasters.
In the aftermath of September 11, it was widely expected that consumer sentiment would plummet and that the data would provide information about the severity of the psychological shock and help to forecast the projected cutback in consumer spending. Even before these data were available, many forecasters were calibrating the impact on consumer spending in terms of the Gulf War experience.
The two leading measures of consumer confidence rendered something of a split decision after September 11. The University of Michigan measure slid in September, but most of the decline occurred before September 11 and was broadly consistent with the deterioration shown by the incoming economic data. This measure has remained fairly stable since then. The Conference Board measure, on the other hand, declined sharply in October, but this sharper drop in the Conference Board measure brought it into closer alignment with the cumulative decline in the Michigan Index. So, surprisingly, at this point, whether September 11 significantly affected consumer confidence is unclear. At least, the effect is smaller than what many had expected.
We don't have good measures of business sentiment, but it is generally reasonable to mark down business spending plans in anticipation of a negative psychological effect if you are doing so for households. In the current case, businesses have apparently made an especially grim assessment of the near-term strength of the economy and orders for nondefense capital goods have plunged, resulting in further cutbacks in investment and downward revisions to the forecast in the near term. On balance, the magnitude of the further declines in consumer and business spending as a result of the events of September 11 is unclear. It seems, in my view, to have had a material effect on business spending and, perhaps, a somewhat smaller effect on consumer spending.
Of course, at times of high of uncertainty, the signals are typically mixed. So they are today. We have some signs of quite remarkable resilience. For example, the stock market plummeted immediately after September 11, but it has already returned to its pre-September 11 level. The exchange value of the dollar, measured against the currencies of a broad range of our trading partners, has remained remarkably stable, despite the presumption that the September 11 shock would disproportionately affect the United States relative to our trading partners. Auto sales soared to record levels in October, prompted, to be sure, by zero-interest rate financing. They likely will fall back once the incentives are reduced, but, in any case, the surge signals that households are still willing to make large long-term commitments despite the uncertainty and risks of a recession. Moreover, non-auto retail sales have recovered some--though not all, to be sure--of the ground they seem to have lost in the immediate aftermath of September 11.
The rest of the short-run forecast. The consensus forecast today is generally described as V-shaped, starting from September 11. This description refers to the pattern of an outright decline in output for a couple of quarters, followed by a quick move to above-trend growth. The forces of recovery include an unusually aggressive macroeconomic policy response, including this year's easing of monetary policy to date and the stimulus associated with a series of fiscal policy actions--including those already implemented and those still under consideration. Until recently, I would have said "under consideration and expected," but recent developments have forced a reassessment of the certainty of a further stimulus package. I will return to the fiscal policy story in a moment.
But more stimulative policies are far from the only factor that should contribute to a rebound. Recoveries also reflect powerful internal dynamics. For example, the amplitude of declines in output during recessions is often determined to a major degree by the severity of inventory liquidation. Once firms have reduced their stocks to desired levels, they quickly raise production to avoid a further decline in stocks. Doing so helps kick-start recoveries. All the natural forces we expected to contribute to recovery before the events of September 11, while perhaps delayed, are likely to become part of the recovery in 2002. Aside from a rebound in inventory investment, these include the end of the retrenchment under way in high-tech investment. Just the return to flat investment spending, from the sharp declines of recent quarters, will give the economy an important boost. Such a rebound will likely be reinforced by a dissipation of gloom and resulting rebound in consumer confidence. Together these factors suggest the potential of a return to more solid rates of growth next year.
Forecasters, at such times as this, like to remind their audiences that they are making conditional forecasts. That is, their forecasts are based on certain assumptions. Of course, a forecaster has to be held accountable for his or her judgment about assumptions, as well as the forecast given the assumptions. But, in this case, a typical assumption is that the terrorist attack was a one-time event and is not followed by other disruptive and destructive events. Of course, the anthrax mail-attacks are another form of terrorism and may have already had an incremental effect on consumer and business psychology and behavior. They will divert additional resources into provision of security rather than production of final output. Until the last few weeks, most of the events that could materially affect the economy seemed more likely to be "bad" events damping near-term confidence and spending. But the more-rapid-than-expected progress of the war in Afghanistan reminds us of the possibility of upside surprises as well. In any case, we must recognize the heightened uncertainty to the forecast associated with the unusual degree of "event risk."
Longer-term considerations. The possible effects of September 11 on productivity growth are the major issues over the longer term. Three sets of forces could lower longer-term productivity growth.
The first is a reallocation of resources toward security away from the production of other goods and services. The purchase of increased security by a firm shows up as an added expense of producing goods. That is, business costs increase without resulting in higher measured output. Costs associated with security definitely are rising noticeably. In addition, some firms may diversify the location of their workers, increasing security at the expense of higher production costs. Financial firms, as well as firms in some other sectors, may build in redundancies to ensure continued operations in the event of future terrorist attacks. Firms may also add a larger buffer in the form of inventories to mitigate the supply disruptions that might follow terrorist attacks, retreating somewhat from just-in-time inventory management.
Many productivity shocks, in my view, are probably more to the level of productivity than to the growth rate of productivity. Of course, if the adjustment to the level occurs over a protracted period, it may feel like a shock to the growth of productivity. With a technological innovation, for example, the higher level of productivity is likely to emerge only gradually, as the innovation is disseminated through the economy. In addition, such a technological advance may not really be a one-time event but may be based on a continuing series of innovations. In any case, such innovations are likely to result in higher growth over a number of years. The effects of higher business costs associated with security are (we can hope) a one-time decline in the level of productivity. I expect the level effect to be completed within only a year or two, given the immediacy of the need. The result in this case is, therefore, a transitory effect on the growth rate of potential output for a year or two, followed by a return to the rate of productivity growth that would have prevailed in the absence of the higher costs for security.
The second set of forces that could lower long-term productivity growth relates to the federal budget. The increased spending on defense and homeland security are unlikely, in my view, to be offset fully by cuts in government spending for other programs or by higher taxes. As a result, budget surpluses will likely be lower over the longer run than otherwise. To the extent that they are, national saving will be lower, real interest rates will be higher, and private capital formation will be lower. As a consequence, the level of productivity will be lower than otherwise, with the growth effect spread over a considerable period. Given the link between national saving and productivity and the dimension of the expected effect, I expect that the resulting decline in productivity through the crowding-out effect would be small, perhaps not more than 1/10 percentage point a year for a while.
Third, a wide variety of other indirect behavioral responses are possible. For example, firms in general may be somewhat more averse to risk and less willing to make long-term commitments. Households may want a larger cushion of accumulated wealth, perhaps increasing the saving rate for a time. They may also reallocate their wealth toward safer and more-liquid assets.
These developments, on balance, would take a toll on longer-term productivity growth. Nevertheless, in my view, they are not large enough to alter the conclusion that the pace of innovation in information technology and other industries has raised underlying productivity growth to a rate faster than prevailed in the twenty-five years prior to the mid-1990s.
Still, the productivity story is exceptionally complex. On the one hand, we can take some comfort that underlying productivity growth should continue at a pace above that achieved from the early 1970s to the mid 1990s. On the other hand, the economy is suffering the consequences of a more recent decline in underlying productivity growth--a decline from the higher rate of underlying productivity growth enjoyed in the late 1990s and into early 2000.
Challenges Facing Monetary Policy
Monetary and fiscal policymakers face many challenges under the circumstances. I will focus on the challenges facing monetary policymakers. One of these is calibrating monetary policy appropriately in light of fiscal policy.
Is Monetary Policy Less Effective than Previously?
Monetary policy before September 11 had eased by 300 basis points, the most aggressive easing over a comparable period in almost twenty years. However, many see the effect of that easing as disappointingly small. As a result, a question often asked today--indeed, almost always asked when the economy is in the midst of a recession or pronounced slowdown--is whether monetary policy is less effective today than it used to be. One explanation is the normal lags in response of spending to monetary policy actions. We would not, for example, have expected much effect through the second quarter and only a modest effect in the second half, based on past experience and the forecasts of our models.
But other factors, too, have contributed to the perception that monetary policy is less effective. These include the fact that the shocks weighing on the economy have been larger in magnitude and spread out in time and, partly as a result, forecasters in general have been continually revising down their forecasts of economic activity. Many have been surprised, in particular, by the sharpness and persistence of the retrenchment in high-tech investment and by the degree to which economic activity abroad slowed along with that in the United States.
Perhaps the most important consideration has been the evolution in overall financial conditions as monetary policy has eased. Monetary policy does not work through the effect of a decline of the federal funds rate itself on spending. Indeed, there is no direct effect here at all. Monetary policy works through the so-called transmission mechanism, through channels that include short-term private interest rates, longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and the exchange rate. The effects on other rates and asset prices depend on the changes in the target funds rate relative to expectations already embedded in the financial markets and on changes in those expectations as a result of policy actions, statements accompanying those actions, and other developments. Other things being equal, a decline in the funds rate will lower short- and long-term private interest rates, raise equity prices, and depreciate the dollar. The combined effects can be quite powerful. In the current episode, however, other things have not been equal, and the dollar has not depreciated nor has the stock market appreciated. Of course, monetary policy presumably wouldn't have eased so much if the dollar had depreciated or the stock market had risen. At any rate, there has been painfully little pass-through from the funds rate to the operative channels, other than declines in private short-term interest rates. The absence of pass-through does not reflect a change in the fundamental effectiveness of monetary policy so much as the offsetting effect of other financial shocks that were occurring at the same time the Fed was easing.
One way of quantifying the degree of pass-through is to compute a financial conditions index that combines the effects of all the transmission channels into a single number. Goldman Sachs and Macroeconomic Advisers have developed differing methodologies for computing such an index. Basically, they weight changes in various financial conditions by their relative importance as determinants of private spending. The message from such indexes is that financial conditions have not improved since the Fed began to ease and, indeed, may even have deteriorated.
The response of overall financial conditions to monetary policy easing in this episode has been unusual, if not unique. In previous recession periods, financial conditions have generally improved as the Fed has eased, reflecting the pass-through to lower short- and long-term private rates, higher equity prices, and a lower exchange rate. The major reason for the failure of financial conditions to improve in this case is that one of the major shocks--the reassessment of the profitability of owning and producing high-tech equipment--was, at the same time, a shock to financial markets and to aggregate demand. The financial shock was the revaluation of equity values as a result of this reassessment--the bursting of the equity bubble in the technology sector. In addition, the dollar appreciated rather than depreciated, for reasons no one seems to fully understand. So two of the key channels in the transmission of monetary policy behaved differently than expected.
Whether or not long-term interest rates have fallen as much as would have been expected from historical regularities is more difficult to assess. One reason is that part of the decline in long-term rates occurred before the Fed began to ease, but in anticipation of that easing. In addition, the limited effect on long-term government rates may partly reflect the offsetting upward pressure from the change in long-term budget implications of recent and prospective fiscal policy measures. These include the large tax cut passed earlier this year, the effect on spending of the fiscal measures already passed in response to the events of September 11, and effect of further spending increases and further tax cuts now under consideration. The fiscal policy effects appear to be contributing to expectations of a robust recovery and a relatively quick and aggressive reversal of monetary policy. This presumption can be seen in the federal funds futures market, from which we can extract a forecast of the expected funds rate over the next year and a half. The market expects the funds rate to begin rebounding in mid-2002 and to rise significantly over the following year. Finally, rising risk spreads have boosted longer-term private rates, especially on below-investment-grade securities.
On balance, a number of factors have combined to restrain the economy, despite the sizable cumulative decline in the federal funds rate. I would not conclude, however, that monetary policy is in general less effective because of structural changes that may have occurred. But I do believe that the financial shocks that have occurred--including the shocks to equity prices and the dollar--have required monetary policy to move more aggressively than otherwise would have been the case.
The Implications of an Initial Low Federal Funds Rate: Hold Our Powder or Respond Especially Aggressively to Adverse Shocks?
On September 11, the federal funds rate was already low--3-1/2 percent. Since that time, the funds rate has been reduced another 1-1/2 percentage points. Indeed, on September 11, there was less room to maneuver than in previous post World War II recessions. Does this mean that the Fed should "keep its powder dry," as some have argued, holding back on further easing in case the downturn turns out to be more serious or in case there are additional adverse shocks? I believe such a strategy would be misguided--indeed the reverse of what would be appropriate.
Given the initial low level of the nominal federal funds rate, we face the risk that, in what is arguably a worst-case scenario, that rate could be driven to zero, the practical limit for a nominal interest rate. This of course is the situation that has lately confronted the Bank of Japan and is referred to the problem of the zero nominal bound. In my view, the appropriate policy response, when confronted with such a potential limit, is to respond especially aggressively to any adverse demand shock, in effect, substituting speed of the move for the cumulative size of the easing. The danger in waiting is that inflation might drift lower, limiting the ability to drive the real federal funds rate into negative territory, as might be necessary to support a timely recovery. In the worst case, as in Japan today, inflation might turn to deflation, limiting the ability to lower the real policy rate even to zero.
The implication of starting with an unusually low interest rate is therefore not to go slowly but to more aggressively respond to any adverse shock. I did not view this consideration as relevant before September 11 and not even immediately after. But it was a consideration in my favoring the last 50-basis point move. At the very least, this line of reasoning is a powerful counter-argument to the "keep your powder dry" strategy.
Monetary and Fiscal Policies
The last of the policy issues I want to address is the relation and interaction between monetary and fiscal policies. Beginning in the Reagan Administration, a division of labor had evolved between these policies. Fiscal policy became less focused on short-run stabilization and more focused on longer-run considerations, such as promoting growth through reductions in marginal tax rates (the Reagan approach) or through reductions in structural budget deficits (the Clinton approach). This left short-run stabilization for the most part in the hands of the Fed.
Many argue that this focus fits with the comparative advantage of monetary and fiscal policies. It is widely believed that monetary policy has no effect on long-term growth rates for real GDP, aside from the benefits arising from achieving and maintaining price stability. In particular, beginning from a position of price stability, more accommodative monetary policy cannot raise the economy's long-term rate of growth. Monetary policy, on the other hand, is often viewed as having a comparative advantage in short-run stabilization. That advantage is based on the ability of monetary policymakers to change policy in a flash, compared with the difficult and often contentious process of legislating changes in taxes or spending, which are subject always to the threat of a presidential veto.
This characterization is, I think, quite fair. It describes differences in what Milton Friedman called the inside lag for the two policies--the lag between the shock and action in response to the shock. The inside lag is unquestionably shorter for monetary policy. But Friedman also noted an outside lag--the lag from the policy response to its effect on aggregate demand and spending. Here the lag for monetary policy is probably longer than for some fiscal policy actions--for example, for spending that can be implemented quickly, like extensions of unemployment insurance, and for some tax changes, including tax rebates or surcharges, changes in withholding rates, and some temporary investment incentives, depending on the specific design. Indeed, Friedman argued that the long and variable lags for monetary policy, due to outside lags, made monetary policy an unlikely instrument for short-run stabilization. Of course, some fiscal policy actions have very gradual effects as well--perhaps as gradual as those from monetary policy actions. These slowing-acting policies include changes in capital gains tax rates, supply-side responses to changes in marginal tax rates, and many programs where spending builds gradually over time.
Monetary and fiscal stimulus can complement each other when shocks are large and adverse and when interest rates are already low. However, putting together an appropriately stimulative fiscal package is not always easy. The political debate and resulting delay in implementing fiscal stimulus following the events of September 11--even when all sides seemed to agree that a prompt fiscal response was appropriate--remind us that fiscal policy generally is not an agile or flexible instrument for short-run stabilization. One recurring problem is that virtually every fiscal change has some effect on the distribution of government benefits or taxes across taxpayers of different incomes. Every time we try to implement a stabilization package, we therefore get Republican and Democratic options that reflect their philosophical differences.
From Reagan through Clinton, it was widely accepted that good fiscal policy meant permanent changes with positive supply-side effects. To be sure, Republicans and Democrats always differed about how to implement such a supply-side fiscal policy. But when the need is for temporary demand-side stimulus, they differ even more.
The first principle in the design of a temporary demand stimulus is, virtually by definition, to avoid permanent changes that were not appropriate before the need for the demand stimulus. Permanent changes mean effects on out-year budgets--in this case lower surpluses, hence lower national saving, higher real interest rates, lower private investment and lower growth in productivity and output. This problem is not just in the future. Bond markets have become very aggressive in building in expectations of rising short-term rates over time into today's long-term interest rates. Higher long-term rates today in response to the long-term effects of permanent fiscal policy changes would offset part of the intended stimulus. The second principle for a temporary demand-side fiscal program is to implement policies that have a large "bang for the buck."
Even with agreement on these two principles, designing a temporary demand-stimulus package is a challenge. In general, temporary policies have effects that are more difficult to predict than those from permanent changes. And temporary policy changes typically leave a hole on the other side and therefore create other problems down the road. Still, on balance, a package of well-crafted, temporary, quick-acting demand-side fiscal measures would, in my view, make a constructive contribution to supporting and strengthening the rebound expected next year.
The current debate in the Congress about fiscal stimulus creates a challenge for forecasters and monetary policymakers alike. Monetary policymakers condition their policy on a forecast, and the forecast must include some assumption about fiscal policy. In most cases, and especially when fiscal policy was not a player in stabilization policy, this dependence of monetary policy on fiscal policy was not a serious issue. But today, the forecast for 2002 is quite sensitive to whether or not a stimulus package is implemented and to the specifics of the package. I, for one, have assumed that the Congress would reach a timely agreement and implement a package with temporary measures characterized by relatively high bangs for the buck. While I have some doubt that this will be the outcome, I have not changed my forecast yet.
Conclusion
The economy contracted in the third quarter and appears to be contracting again in the current quarter. Fortunately, a considerable amount of stimulus is already in train because of the combination of monetary policy easing and fiscal policy measures already enacted. The Congress may still pass additional fiscal stimulus before year-end. In addition, the internal dynamics that support recovery may soon come into play. In this case, the economy should gradually strengthen over next year. For the moment, the risks continue to be to the down side, but the front-loaded response of monetary policy has already made an important contribution to countering the further adverse shock and, in addition, has provided some insurance against downside risks. Once the economy shows signs of moving to a rate of growth above trend, the Fed will have to reassess the appropriate degree of stimulus and, at some point, begin the return to a more neutral policy.'''

data.at[256,'speech'] = a_2001_5

a_2001_4 = '''During the past several years, changes in asset prices have attracted considerable attention from the public, from economic researchers, and from monetary policymakers. That attention is well deserved: Recent changes in asset valuations have been enormous, and they appear to have had substantial effects on the economy.
The observation that asset prices influence macroeconomic performance is hardly new. Undergraduate macroeconomic textbooks generally teach that increases in wealth should boost household spending and that increases in stock prices should stimulate business investment. Moreover, a growing body of empirical evidence at both the aggregate level and the level of individual households and businesses supports these basic presumptions. But while progress has been made, I believe that our understanding of the empirical relationships and of the theoretical underpinnings of those relationships still remains incomplete.
My remarks today will cover three topics. First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment. Second, I will highlight a few aspects of the relationship between asset prices and household spending that I believe merit further research. Third, I will review how monetary policy has responded to asset price fluctuations among other elements of the economic environment in the United States during the past few years.
Empirical Evidence on Asset Prices and Spending
At the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years. The forecasting model in use at the Federal Reserve Board in the early 1970s incorporated a 5-1/2 cent increase in consumption for each dollar of additional wealth. The econometric model of the U.S. economy in use today at the Federal Reserve Board includes a wealth effect as well, although somewhat smaller in size. Not all researchers agree, but most statistical studies suggest that an additional dollar of household wealth leads, over time, to a permanent rise in household consumption of about three to five cents.
An important question for both economists and policymakers is whether households’ net worth summarizes all of the information about their balance sheets that is useful in predicting their spending, or whether a decomposition of net worth into various asset and liability categories can improve forecasts of their spending. Unfortunately, this question has proved difficult to answer. Today I will focus on the possibly different influences of equity wealth and housing wealth, although other components of balance sheets may be important as well.
In the current version of the Federal Reserve’s econometric model, the estimated marginal propensities to consume out of stock market and other wealth are virtually indistinguishable. However, I would not want to exaggerate the ability of either the data or our statistical tools to pinpoint these separate influences, and at times in the past, the model’s estimated marginal propensity to consume out of non-stock-market wealth has been nearly twice as large as the marginal propensity to consume out of stock market wealth. Moreover, some recent research conducted outside the Federal Reserve argues that the marginal propensity to consume out of housing wealth likely exceeds the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth.
The relationship between wealth and consumption as reflected in the Fed’s model has certainly had some real-world analogues in the past few years. For instance, sales of luxury goods such as jewelry and expensive automobiles were very brisk in the late 1990s, with reports indicating that spending was especially robust in locales where individuals were reaping large wealth gains from the technology and financial sectors. More generally, we observed a dramatic decline in the personal saving rate in the late 1990s. Personal saving--which is measured in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked. The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the Fed’s model.
Nevertheless, until recently economists have been able to marshal little formal evidence that the observed relationship between aggregate spending and aggregate wealth could be traced to changes in spending by those households that actually experienced wealth gains. But that gap in our understanding is now being filled, at least regarding equity wealth. Several recent papers--including some by economists at the Federal Reserve Board--have documented a microeconomic relationship corresponding to the relationship that we have long observed in aggregate data.
For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of U.S. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the United States showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2
Unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited. But the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest. I hope that future analyses will add to our understanding of this linkage.
Hence there seems little empirical question that changes in household net worth cause changes in household spending. To be sure, not every analysis of the link between stock prices and spending comes to the same conclusions as those of the studies I mentioned. Moreover, we certainly do not have a complete understanding of all aspects of this relationship. For example, we have fairly limited evidence to guide us on the important issue of distinguishing the role of housing wealth from equity wealth. On balance, however, the link between aggregate household wealth and spending has remained one of the sturdier relationships in macroeconomics.
When we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker. Indeed, neither Tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests. Other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices. However, some careful research--again partly conducted by Federal Reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 Other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4
This important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today. Let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, I believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly.
Two Unresolved Issues Regarding the Link between Wealth and Consumption
Let me return to the relationship between household wealth and consumption. Although the current body of empirical literature on this topic sends a rather clear message, it does not answer all the questions. Let me highlight two unresolved issues that I find particularly intriguing and that deserve further study.
The first issue pertains to the underlying forces causing the value of the stock market to change. The value of equities can change for two basic reasons: because market participants adopt a new view of future profits, or because market participants apply a different set of discount factors to those expectations of future profits. The discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premia, but I will refer to the discount factors simply as interest rates.
Consider the effect of an increase in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity. To the extent that higher expected profits reflect higher expected future output and income--and not just a redistribution of income from labor to capital--both economic intuition and formal models suggest that desired household spending should increase, all else equal. Consumers foresee their future higher income and want to spend some of it now. That response is a straightforward wealth effect on consumption. Now consider instead the effect of a decrease in interest rates, setting aside for a moment the implications of the interest-rate decline for investment and future output. In this scenario, households are not expecting higher future returns but are simply discounting the same stream of returns at a different rate, so it is less clear that they are truly better off and should increase their consumption.
A further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates. The nature and magnitude of these interactions depend on the consumption and investment decisions of households and firms, on the extent of unused labor and capital resources, on the openness of the economy, and on other factors. Untangling these connections is difficult theoretically, and even more so empirically. But the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption. Analyses of the wealth effect often give insufficient weight to these complexities. I believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.
A second area in which some further work is warranted is housing. The basic puzzle is this: Roughly speaking, the population currently occupies the stock of residential real estate and will continue to do so no matter what happens to its price. Suppose there is a rise in the relative price of housing. There is no doubt that this rise would increase computed nominal net worth, but why should it support increases in household spending?
To articulate the puzzle more carefully, suppose that I intend to live in my current house forever and that the price of the house increases because of a decline in the discount rate for future housing services. In that case, my measured nominal wealth would be greater, but the nominal value of the housing services I am consuming currently and will consume in the future would also be greater. Thus, the increase in the value of my home would not provide me with any additional resources for greater consumption of real housing services or other goods and services.
Yet, as I noted earlier, the empirical evidence supports the view that changes in the price of residential real estate do affect household spending. So what is missing from our simple story? One possibility is that the hypothesized increase in the price of my house reflects a change in the housing services that the house is expected to provide, perhaps because individuals have come to think that houses will depreciate more slowly in the future than we had believed. In this situation, a higher house price would be accompanied by an increase in my real consumption of housing services over time but--as long as I stayed in the same house--by no change in my consumption of other goods and services.
A second complicating factor is that many homeowners do not intend to live in their current houses forever. Many expect to move to smaller houses, condominiums, or retirement communities as they get older. These individuals, who plan to “downsize” their housing over time, are truly better off when house prices increase, and any standard theory would predict that they will increase their consumption. At the same time, many individuals who do not currently own homes--or who own small homes--likely plan to purchase homes and increase their consumption of housing services in the future. These “upsizers” are worse off when house prices increase, and they will reduce their consumption of non-housing goods and services. The effect of changes in house prices on desired aggregate consumption depends on the relative number of individuals in these two groups and their marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth.
A third factor, which Chairman Greenspan has recently emphasized, is the effect of realizing capital gains in housing by selling one’s house or by borrowing through a home equity loan. Accumulated home equity is not itself a liquid asset. In addition, its value is somewhat uncertain: Although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed, nobody receives a statement in the mail saying how much his or her home is worth, and nobody can look up the value of his or her home in the newspaper. Selling a house, or getting one’s house appraised and taking out a home equity loan, converts this illiquid home equity of uncertain value into liquid funds with known value.
Recent Experience and the Response of Monetary Policy
Let me now turn to the recent U.S. experience, including the macroeconomic consequences of movements in asset prices since the mid-1990s and the response of monetary policymakers. As you know, the second half of the 1990s saw a record-breaking run-up in equity values in the United States. In early 1995, the net worth of U.S. households was about 4-1/2 times their after-tax income, quite close to the average ratio during the preceding quarter century. Roughly five years later, in early 2000, the ratio of wealth to disposable income peaked at more than 6--the highest value in the fifty years for which comparable wealth data are available. Now, approaching the end of 2001, the wealth-income ratio has fallen back nearly to 5--still a bit high by historical standards but well below the peak.
The primary driver of these recent developments has been the dramatic advance and partial retreat in the value of publicly traded equities. Between early 1995 and the peak in early 2000, the Wilshire 5000 stock-price index (which is a broad measure of equity prices) tripled, adding nearly $12 trillion to the wealth of U.S. households. Since the peak, the Wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5
Not only have the recent movements in U.S. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the United States. According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, which is conducted every three years by the Federal Reserve, roughly 32 percent of American families owned equities in 1989 (either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, retirement accounts, and other managed assets). By 1998, 49 percent owned equities in some form.6 Thus, in less than a decade, the United States evolved from a society in which one-third of families owned stocks to one in which one-half of families owned stocks.
During the same period, the value of residential real estate rose, but more slowly and more steadily than did the value of equities. Ten years ago, the value of residential real estate was about twice the value of the household sector’s corporate equities. As stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing. However, the recent combination of a strong housing market and faltering stock market has put aggregate housing wealth back on par with aggregate equity wealth.
Now let me turn to the influence of these movements in asset prices on the conduct of monetary policy. The fundamental goal of our policy is to achieve maximum sustainable output and employment, which can be reached best in an environment of price stability. Therefore, the Federal Reserve must take an active interest in all the factors that affect economic performance, including business and consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, fiscal policy, and, of course, asset prices. We take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy. But let me be clear: We do not target a particular level of equity prices. We attempt simply to judge the likely influence of the stock market as well as other important factors on the level of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and, hence, on the economy’s ability to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable employment. In this respect, the stock market plays the same role in our analysis as does any other influence on our outlook. While our goal of price stability can foster a favorable environment for business investment, we make no pretense to being able to control how that plays out in the stock market. We cannot avoid gauging the effect of the stock market on economic performance, but we do not target stock prices.
The dramatic movements in asset prices over the past several years have affected aggregate demand and, to some extent, aggregate supply in the United States. In the late 1990s, the growth rate of U.S. labor productivity increased beyond the expectations of most observers. An important source of the faster pace of productivity was a surge in capital spending fostered by the development of new technology. Faster productivity growth was among the factors that boosted equity valuations; in turn, larger expected productivity advances and a lower cost of equity capital provided a further stimulus to investment. The pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand. The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.
However, by the summer of 1999, the persistent strength of domestic demand and tightening resource utilization in the United States, especially for labor, heightened concern among policymakers that inflationary pressures could undermine the impressive performance of the economy. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates. The objective was not to bring down the stock market but rather to bring the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better alignment.
Of course, the U.S. economy has now slowed very sharply. One factor has been the apparent reconsideration of expected profitability in the high-tech sector. This reassessment depressed equity prices for high-tech firms, and it has significantly restrained investment in these types of equipment, which had been substantial contributors to the previously rapid rate of economic growth. Slowing investment and a shift from a positive to a negative wealth effect on consumption have significantly damped the growth in aggregate final demand since late last year. The associated inventory correction has accentuated the decline in production. Since the September 11 terrorist attacks, heightened uncertainty and concerns have also weighed on the U.S. economy. These factors, and many others, have informed our decision to shift the stance of monetary policy aggressively and reduce the target federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the year.
Conclusion
Hence there is no question that asset prices influence the macroeconomy. They should theoretically, and they clearly seem to empirically. But one would think that wealth changes coming from investors’ re-evaluation of future profits would have different effects from those coming from interest-rate changes or changes in the relative price of housing. This puzzle should, I feel, loom large on the research agenda for academic economists and, for obvious reasons, on the policy agenda for central banks.'''

a_2001_15 = '''When I began writing this paper, projections of federal budget surpluses raised the possibility that the outstanding stock of Treasury debt might be eliminated over the next ten years. While everyone understood that considerable uncertainties--related to economic assumptions and future policy decisions--surrounded these projections, they required that the Federal Reserve take seriously the possibility that monetary policy might have to be conducted without Treasury securities. The events since September 11, including a significantly expanded path for federal expenditures and the potential for further tax cuts, have at least delayed such an outcome and have added significantly to the uncertainty about projections of future surpluses. Nevertheless, it seems prudent to continue to plan for the contingency that over some longer period the federal debt might, at least for a while, be eliminated.
In discussing the implications for monetary policy, it is useful to separate monetary policy actions into two steps. In the first step, the policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target for the federal funds rate. In the second step, policy implementation, the manager of the Fed's portfolio, the System Open Market Account (SOMA), injects or withdraws reserves to achieve a funds rate consistent with the FOMC's target. The formal procedural link between the two decisions is the FOMC's directive to the manager of SOMA, calling on him or her to conduct appropriate operations to support the FOMC's policy decision.
While continued unified budget surpluses leading to the elimination of Treasury securities would have some important macroeconomic implications for our policy decisions, the elimination of Treasury securities should not influence either the way the FOMC makes its policy decisions or the use of reserve injections or withdrawals to implement these decisions. But such a development would require some changes in the way that reserves are injected or withdrawn.
I will be discussing some options for adapting the implementation of monetary policy to a world without Treasury securities, but the key message is not to worry. There are plenty of options, the Fed will get the job done, so the elimination of Treasury debt would not undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Before proceeding, I note that the views I am presenting today are my own. I am not speaking for the Board of Governors or the FOMC.
Monetary Policy Today
The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge for lending reserves to other banks. It is therefore fundamentally determined by supply and demand in the reserves market. The Federal Reserve controls the supply of reserves and can therefore adjust the supply to ensure that the market clears at the FOMC's target funds rate.
The principal method of injecting or withdrawing reserves today is open market operations, which take two forms. The first form is outright purchase or sale of Treasury securities from the Fed's portfolio. The size of that portfolio today is about $525 billion. Open market purchases of securities inject reserves into the banking system, and open market sales withdraw reserves.
The second type is temporary operations, either repurchase agreements to temporarily add reserves or reverse repurchase agreements (sometimes referred to as matched sale-repurchase agreements) to temporarily withdraw reserves. Repurchase agreements are essentially short-term loans collateralized by acceptable assets. The Fed, technically, buys the underlying asset for a given price with an agreement by the selling institution to buy it back at a specified date and price. The difference between the purchase and buyback prices determines the interest rate on the loan (the repo rate). The Federal Reserve engages in temporary transactions almost every day to compensate for short-run fluctuations in other elements of its balance sheet, such as currency outstanding, float, or Treasury deposits.
Both outright operations and temporary operations are implemented through transactions with primary security dealers. In the case of repurchase agreements, these dealers become the direct counterparty in the transaction, owing to the buyback obligation. About half of temporary operations involve Treasury securities as collateral; the other half use either federal agency debt or mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the federal agencies.
Reserves are also injected or withdrawn through discount window loans. These loans are made at the discretion of a bank, subject to Fed restrictions related to the financial soundness of the bank and the use of the funds. In ordinary circumstances, discount window loans are a negligible source of reserves, primarily because banks are reluctant to be seen as borrowing from the Fed. They fear that doing so may raise questions in the market and with the Fed about the management of their liquidity and their overall safety and soundness. However, in extraordinary times, such as in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 tragedies, borrowing from the discount window can become a major source of reserve creation.
Principles
Before considering how to replace Treasury securities in the implementation of monetary policy, I find it useful to set out some principles that have, at least implicitly, traditionally been followed. These principles provide guidance on how to proceed without Treasuries and identify tradeoffs that would inevitably arise.
First, the Federal Reserve should try to be as neutral as possible with respect to effects on credit and, ultimately, on resource allocation. The market can do this far better than we can. The role of monetary policy is to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment by influencing the level of aggregate demand through changes in the federal funds rate. In carrying out this responsibility, the Fed should aim to have as little effect as possible on the allocation of credit among various sectors or the allocation of resources more generally across industries or sectors.
Second, and closely related to the first point, the Fed does not want to risk facing political pressure to influence the allocation of credit or resources. It avoids that pressure today, in part, by confining its holdings of assets primarily to Treasury securities. If the Fed were to hold a range of private assets instead of Treasury securities, it could face pressure to favor certain sectors, industries, or even firms. The potential for such political pressure might best be minimized by deciding on the portfolio allocation transparently and establishing safeguards against becoming an instrument of credit allocation. If the Congress enlarges the range of assets we can hold, for example, it ought to clearly and explicitly prohibit us from favoring one sector over another.
Third, to avoid affecting credit allocation, it would be preferable to carry out operations in deep and liquid markets. A liquid market permits transactions to be made quickly and with negligible direct effects on the price of the assets bought and sold. The purpose of open market operations is to affect the supply of reserves and thereby the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate and expectations about future monetary policy then affect a wide range of other interest rates--on longer-term instruments and in both the government and private bond markets. By operating in a broad and liquid market, the Fed can inject and withdraw reserves without having much direct effect on the prices of the asset being bought and sold.1
Finally, the Fed would prefer to avoid credit risk in its portfolio. Managing credit risk is a role for financial intermediaries, not monetary policymakers. Owning risky assets necessarily involves taking losses at some point, involving the Federal Reserve in complex questions of whether the taxpayer had been adequately compensated for the risk. In addition, once the Fed takes on credit risk, avoiding some effect on the allocation of credit and resources across sectors would be more difficult.
The current arrangements, focused on open market operations in Treasury securities, allow the Fed to honor these principles and involve few of the tradeoffs that would inevitably arise under alternative arrangements. The Treasury market is deep and highly liquid. In addition, reliance on Treasuries avoids both credit risk and opportunities for political pressure to influence the allocation of credit.
In the absence of Treasury securities, honoring all these principles almost certainly would not be possible. The key decisions would require an assessment of the tradeoffs among the principles. For example, if we ruled out taking on any credit risk, we might preclude holding assets other than direct government debt, agency debt that is explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the government (for example, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae), and high-rated foreign sovereign debt. Doing so, however, would exclude a wide range of private assets that the Fed might otherwise hold. So it is important to recognize that tradeoffs exist. It may be deemed necessary, in particular, to accept that some credit risk will have to be taken and to focus on managing that risk, on maintaining neutrality by operating in a wide range of markets, and on avoiding political pressure through a clear and explicit prohibition against favoring particular sectors.
Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries
Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.
First, the Fed could replace Treasury securities in its portfolio with other assets and carry out outright purchases and sales from the new portfolio as it does from the current one. Second, the Fed could widen the collateral acceptable for repurchase agreements and make greater use of repurchase agreements relative to outright purchases and sales. Because the Fed already transacts about half its temporary operations with collateral other than Treasury securities, this option would involve moving further along a path we are already on. Third, the Fed could make greater use of loans through the discount window. I would like to explore each of these directions.
1. Replace Treasury securities with other assets in the Fed's portfolio. The Federal Reserve could replace its current holdings of Treasury securities either with other assets that it is already authorized to hold or a wider range of other assets, including some that could only be purchased if the Fed were granted new legislative authority. This direction, however, is the boldest one and could raise concerns about neutrality, credit risk, and political pressure. However, in principle, a rules-based and index-focused approach could reduce the potential for effects on resource allocation, control risk exposure through diversification, and lessen the opportunity for political pressure.
The Federal Reserve, by statute, has authority to hold (1) Treasury securities, (2) federal agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, (3) bankers acceptances, (4) foreign sovereign debt, (5) certain municipal securities, (6) foreign exchange, and (7) gold.
Currently the FOMC authorizes SOMA to make outright purchases only of Treasury securities and federal agency debt. Agency debt, however, makes up only a tiny fraction of the portfolio today and there have been no outright purchases since 1981. The gold and foreign sovereign debt in the portfolio reflect an earlier historic role for gold and stem from interventions in exchange markets rather than from open market operations to affect the reserve base.
The most obvious candidates for holding the Fed's permanent portfolio are from those assets allowed by statute but not currently being purchased by SOMA. This group includes federal agency debt, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the agencies, and foreign sovereign debt.
About $2 trillion is in federal agency debt outstanding, and $2.6 trillion is in mortgage backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae carry the full faith and credit of the federal government, whereas the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not. By comparison, marketable Treasury securities outstanding outside the government total $2.8 trillion.
However, holding debt issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in the Fed's portfolio, to the exclusion of other private assets, would, in my view, reinforce the market perception of the special status of federal agency debt. This would increase the subsidy that already exists in this market, potentially further distorting the allocation of credit and resources. Any decision to move in this direction, therefore, might be best linked to a broader decision to change the Federal Reserve Act to allow the Federal Reserve to hold private debt in its portfolio. In that case, federal agency debt could be treated symmetrically with high-grade commercial paper and corporate bonds. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities insured by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac should not be treated differently from other highly-rated private debt. Of course, holding only federal agency debt, mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the federal agencies, and other similarly highly-grade private debt would still distort credit allocation by favoring high-grade over other private debt--but it would dilute the federal agency advantage. Federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the federal agencies also could be held as part of a wider range of private debt.
The Fed holds foreign sovereign debt today in order to earn interest on its foreign exchange holdings which it acquired in the course of interventions over the years. The question here is whether the Fed should also carry out open market operations by buying and selling such debt. The effect of doing so would be essentially the same as a foreign exchange intervention. This raises a host of questions about the suitability of such operations.
It first raises a question of whether such operations would have to be coordinated with the Treasury, given that both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are authorized to intervene in foreign exchange markets and routinely coordinate their interventions. Second, buying and selling foreign sovereign debt would have a direct effect on the countries whose assets we were buying or selling and could interfere with their domestic policies. Though these considerations weigh against holding foreign sovereign debt in the permanent portfolio, such debt could be used as collateral for dollar-denominated repurchase agreements with dealers. Such transactions would not change the currency composition of the SOMA portfolio and would be less likely to affect exchange rates or the price of such debt.
The markets for several of the other assets currently allowable by statute may be too small or too illiquid to be useful in open market operations. The bankers acceptance market is a relic of an earlier age and is now too small and inactive to serve as an option. The market for short-term municipal debt (the municipal debt the Fed is authorized by statute to hold) is also quite small and not very liquid. Gold does not yield a stream of earnings, and using gold for open market operations would also involve the cost of physical delivery.
A second category of potential assets consists of assets that would require legislative change to authorize the Fed to purchase and sell. This category includes all other private debt, equities, and other financial claims. The total size of the market for private debt of domestic businesses is about $15 trillion. Specifically, it includes the corporate bond market (about $5 trillion) and the commercial paper market (about $1.5 trillion) in addition to federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by the agencies. However, a considerable portion of this debt does not trade on markets but is held by financial institutions. These assets could be indirectly included in the Fed's portfolio by having the Fed purchase claims on financial institutions, including money market mutual funds, federal funds (uncollateralized loans in the interbank market), and certificates of deposit (CDs), including euro-dollar CDs.
Another class of assets that could be held in the Fed's portfolio consists of securitized assets other than mortgage-backed securities--an asset class that has been expanding rapidly. Finally, equities could be held as well as private debt. This market, including both equities directly held and those held indirectly through ownership of shares in mutual funds, is about $16 trillion. Many of the markets for private debt and equities are large, but some are not very liquid, and all involve some credit or market risk. I also note that double-counting in these numbers is considerable since money market mutual funds, for example, hold a lot of commercial paper.
2. Greater use of repurchase agreements against a wider range of collateral. Today, about $25 billion in Federal Reserve repurchase agreements is outstanding. The amount outstanding swung over a wide range in 1999 and 2000, rising to supply liquidity before and immediately after the Y2K rollover and then declining to more normal levels. The amount again escalated sharply as the Fed sought to provide liquidity to the financial system in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. At the peak around the Y2K rollover and in the days after the terrorist attacks, more than $100 billion in repurchase agreements was outstanding. These experiences suggest that these transactions have considerable potential elasticity, even under prevailing restrictions on collateral. On the other hand, these were unusual experiences in which the demand for financing from the Federal Reserve was boosted by private-sector caution and difficulties. As a result, one should be cautious in using these experiences as a measure of how much this source of supply could easily be expanded in more normal circumstances. In any case, the opportunities to enlarge the size of such transactions would of course increase if the acceptable collateral were expanded, though doing so would require a change in law.
If the range of acceptable assets were increased, repurchase agreements would have an advantage over direct purchases in that they carry less credit risk. The reason repurchase agreements have this advantage is that they are two-name paper: the immediate counterparty of the loan is the primary dealer and the collateral in repurchase agreements provides additional protection. For the Fed to take a loss, the direct counterparty would have to default, and either the market value of the collateral would have to decline or the issuer of the asset held as collateral would have to default. Also, a reliance on repurchase agreements would probably create less effect on the markets for the collateral asset than the outright purchase and sale of the asset from the Fed's portfolio. However, repurchase agreements would still have some effect on market liquidity and pricing for assets newly used as collateral.
Expanding the use of repurchase agreements against a wide range of collateral might also be helpful during a transition to zero public debt. It would, for example, provide additional time to consider the pros and cons of outright purchases of a wider range of assets.
3. Greater use of loans through the discount window. Another way to increase the supply of reserves is through expanded discount window loans. Today, such loans are made at the initiative of banks, subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. In normal times, a negligible amount of reserves are supplied through the discount window, owing both to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve to limit use of this subsidized source of funds and to the reluctance of banks to borrow from the Fed. In the early history of the Federal Reserve, however, the discount window was the principal vehicle for adjusting the amount of reserves available to the banking system. Given the reluctance of banks to borrow from the discount window today, some new procedure for supplying credit through the window would need to be developed to allow it to become a more significant source of reserves. In addition, even if we overcame the reluctance of banks to borrow, we would likely need an alternative to the current active administration of the window if we wanted to have a significantly higher amount of discount window borrowing.
One possibility would be to auction discount-window credit. Doing so would, to a degree, shift the initiative on amounts to the Federal Reserve. Auctions could be held for loans with terms of a couple of weeks or even quarters. The rate for such lending would be set in the auction market and, being secured loans, would likely be slightly lower than the rate on term federal funds of comparable maturity.
An advantage of this direction is that the Fed already has authority to accept a wide range of collateral for discount window loans and, indeed, does accept a wide range of collateral today. However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions. In addition, it would add to the Fed's burden in monitoring the risks of the borrowing institutions and managing the collateral associated with the loans. Obviously, these considerations would be less significant if the facility involved a more modest expansion of discount window borrowing.
A new facility would have to set some standards regarding which banks could borrow from the Fed. These standards could be based, for example, on supervisory ratings. They are necessary to prevent the window from so being used to enable weak banks to avoid market disruption. Banks that met the threshold could borrow without the use of the funds. The Federal Reserve would have to give thought as to whether the borrowings of any institution should be limited in amount or frequency to forestall credit market distortions.
A Multifaceted Approach
An approach that uses all of the possibilities I've identified might be the best direction. I start from the perspective that there are three different drivers of reserve injection and withdrawal in the implementation of monetary policy. The first driver is the long-term increase in the demand for currency and reserves. The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves. And the third driver is the day-to-day adjustment needed to keep the funds rate in line with the FOMC's target.
One way to think about the three drivers and their associated transactions is in terms of a multifaceted approach consisting of three portfolios. One portfolio might be focused on providing for the gradual long-term increase in the demand for currency and reserves. The second might provide for intermediate-term needs for reserve expansion or contraction. And the third portfolio might be designed specifically to provide for the day-to-day adjustments to keep the federal funds rate in line with the FOMC's target.
1. The permanent portfolio. Long-term secular increases in the demand for currency or the demand for reserves could be met by outright purchases when the most important considerations would be neutrality and managing credit risk and when liquidity would be of less concern. I think that such demand could be well accommodated by a strategy of buying a slice of the same assets held by the private sector. We might think of this portfolio as one large index fund, with all private debt, equity, and other financial claims represented in proportion to their outstanding stocks.
A major decision with regard to this portfolio would be whether or not to include equities as well as private debt. Equities are fundamentally different from debt in that they confer ownership and a role in management of the firm to the equity owner. Allowing the government to have, and perhaps exercise, wide-ranging ownership rights over private businesses would clearly be quite a significant move. With debt, however, the holder generally has no influence on management, especially if the debt is acquired in the secondary market (so the holder does not negotiate any covenants associated with the debt) and if the firm is not in bankruptcy. In the case of a firm in bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve would still need guidelines to govern its conduct as holder of private debt.
On the other hand, including equities in the permanent portfolio would best respect the principle of neutrality. The government could hold a wider range of private-sector assets and possibly avoid altering the relative attractiveness of debt versus equity financing. Also, given the large size of this market, including equities it would allow the government to hold a smaller share of all private debt, further minimizing potential distortions.
The permanent portfolio could be adjusted in several ways to reduce the cost of administering it and to manage credit risk. First, credit risk could be controlled both by diversification (as with indexing) and by acquiring only investment-grade assets. However, a decision to purchase only high-grade debt would significantly undermine the objective of avoiding an effect on the allocation of credit. In decisions about the composition of the permanent portfolio, it might be best to give the greatest weight to maintaining neutrality. Credit risk could be managed through the diversification implied by the neutrality objective and by relying on the presumption that the higher return on riskier assets appropriately compensates for default risk, especially within a diversified portfolio.
Second, a measure of liquidity and transparency could be ensured by limiting assets to those traded on markets with reasonable pricing transparency and some acceptable liquidity. But, again, liquidity is less important for the long-term portfolio than neutrality.
Third, some of the claims could be on financial institutions as a substitute for directly holding the loans and other primary debt (loans to households and businesses) that such institutions hold.
The system could be managed internally or externally. I favor external management. Specifically, we could ask for proposals for a mutual fund that would operate under some strict guidelines, related to appropriate indexing and asset quality. Holding the assets through a mutual fund could also distance the Federal Reserve from a management role in the companies issuing the equities.
2. The intermediate portfolio. Some occasions call for significant swings in currency or reserves because of seasonal demands for cash and loans. Such injections or withdrawals of reserves are neither as permanent (as those in the long-term portfolio) nor as transitory as the operations that would be handled in the third portfolio I will discuss later.
In addition, in some periods the onset of financial stress may require a large increase in reserves to meet the demand for liquidity or the Fed may need to withdraw a large volume of reserves to offset increased discount window borrowing. These periods also require operations that are temporary but that last longer overnight.
Term repurchase agreements might fill this need very well, perhaps against a wider range of collateral than employed today. Today, most repurchase agreements are overnight, although the FOMC has authorized term repurchase agreements of as long as ninety days. A second source of such intermediate reserve operations could be the discount window. Credit could be auctioned for weeks or months to fill this need. Regular, say weekly, term actions of repurchase agreements and discount window loans would afford considerable flexibility because they could be allowed to run off or to be added to each auction.
3. The short-term or liquidity portfolio. Day-to-day shocks to the supply and demand for reserves must be offset to maintain the federal funds rate at its target level. Most of these shocks are transitory, so the need is for temporary injections or withdrawals of reserves. The key to this component of the portfolio is liquidity. As always, ensuring neutrality and avoiding credit risk remain important objectives, though neutrality would be best judged by looking at all three portfolios together.
Overnight or short-term repurchase agreements are ideal for this role. Outright purchases or sales from the most liquid components of the permanent portfolio--for example, using short-term agency debt and high-grade commercial paper--could supplement short-term repurchase agreements if necessary.
Conclusion
The Federal Reserve has a range of options to consider if it has to adapt to a world without Treasury securities. These options collectively provide an effective means for implementing the policy decisions of the FOMC. The key will be to design a strategy that respects the principles I have discussed and makes careful judgments about the inevitable tradeoffs among the principles. The public, including specialists in the various markets, will have ample opportunity to provide input on these options, and these contributions will no doubt help us in reaching a final decision. Events, of course, have conspired to make this decision less pressing, but it remains our responsibility to be prepared.'''

# a_2002_19 = '''The rapid technological innovation that spurred the advancement of the "information economy" has resulted in some dramatic capital gains and losses in equity markets in recent years. These remarkable developments have attracted considerable attention from economists and from macroeconomic policymakers. At the same time, movements in the prices of some other assets in the economy--changes in house prices, for example--have been steadier, less dramatic, but perhaps no less significant.
# There can be little doubt that sizable swings in the market values of business and household assets have created important challenges for policymakers. After having been relatively stable for a number of decades, the aggregate ratio of household net worth to income rose steeply over the second half of the 1990s and reached an unprecedented level by early last year. That ratio has subsequently retraced some of its earlier gains.
# But we must ask whether the aggregate ratio of net worth to income is a sufficient statistic for summarizing the effect of capital gains on economic behavior or, alternatively, whether the distribution of capital gains across assets and the manner in which those gains are realized also are significant determinants of spending. To answer these questions, we need far more information than we currently possess about the nature and the sources of capital gains and the interaction of these gains with credit markets and consumer behavior.
# Analysts have long factored changing asset values into models that seek to explain consumption and investment. Indeed, in recent years, household wealth variables have become increasingly important quantitatively in endeavors to track consumer spending. The importance of household balance sheet variables for explaining consumption and the possibility that not all these variables influence spending identically suggest the need for greater disaggregation than is typically employed in most models.
# Observing that, over the past half century, consumer spending has amounted to about 90 percent of income, it might appear that income is largely sufficient to explain consumption. However, econometric evidence suggests that such numbers may be deceptive. Wealth by itself now appears to explain about one-fifth of the total level of consumer outlays, according to the Board's large-scale econometric model, leaving disposable income and other factors to explain only four-fifths of consumption. Indeed, if capital gains have any effect on consumption, the propensity of households to spend out of income must be less, possibly much less, than 90 percent.
# If income and wealth moved tightly together over time, the distinction between them might not be meaningful for predicting the future path of consumption. And, over very long periods of time, capital gains on physical assets are not independent of the trends in disposable income. But the relationship of wealth to income is demonstrably not stable over time spans relevant for the conduct of policy. As a consequence, a statistical system that augments income as a determinant of consumer spending with information about wealth can significantly assist our understanding of this key economic relationship.
# Conventional regression analysis suggests that a permanent one-dollar increase in the level of household wealth raises the annual level of personal consumption expenditures approximately 3 to 5 cents after due consideration of lags. Arguably, it would not be important to draw distinctions among various types of wealth if all assets were engendering similar rates of capital gains. Owing to collinearity in such instances, all wealth proxies would produce similar estimates of overall wealth effects on consumer spending.
# At times, however, the rates of change in key asset prices have diverged. For example, over the past year and a half, home values have appreciated, whereas equity values have contracted significantly. In such circumstances, differences in the propensities to consume out of the capital gains and losses on different types of assets could have significant implications for aggregate demand.
# Assuming that the underlying propensities are, in fact, stable and given enough time-series data with sufficient variation, standard regression procedures should be able to extract reasonably robust estimates of any differential in spending propensities--for example, out of stock market wealth and home wealth. But, in practice, these circumstances do not prevail. As a consequence, we at the Federal Reserve Board are in the process of developing balance-sheet disaggregations that should help us infer the propensities to spend out of capital gains across different classes of assets.
# In carrying out this analysis, we have been especially mindful of the possibility that the amount by which a capital gain affects spending may well be a function of whether or not the gain has been realized. On the buyer's side, when an asset is transferred, the acquisition cost is its new book value and, by definition, its market value. On the seller's side, the proceeds from the sale are available for asset accumulation, debt repayment, and consumption. In this way, a capital gain is realized and made liquid, with the potential to affect spending, assets, or debt. The capital gain in the process disappears as an element in the householder's balance sheet.
# Unrealized gains, to be sure, can be borrowed against, and the proceeds of the loan can be spent or used for repayment of other debt. Alternatively, the unrealized gain could induce households to finance additional outlays by selling other assets or by reducing their saving out of current income. But unless, or until, this gain is realized or is extinguished by a fall in market price, it will remain on the asset side of the householder's balance sheet, exposed to price change and uncertainty.
# Equity extraction through realized gains creates liquid funds with certain value. Indeed, a significant proportion of sellers do not purchase another home. In contrast, extraction of unrealized gains does not reduce the householders' uncertainty about their net worth or their exposure to market price changes. This suggests that the propensity to spend out of realized gains is likely to be greater than the propensity to spend out of unrealized gains.
# Although our asset-class analysis of detailed disaggregated data is still at an early stage, preliminary examination finds that the data are consistent with the hypothesis of differential spending propensities by asset type and by whether or not capital gains have been realized. For example, purchasers of existing homes, on average, appear to take out mortgages about twice the size of the unamortized mortgage that the typical seller cancels on sale. After accounting for closing expenses, the remaining unencumbered cash is available for debt repayment, acquisition of financial and nonfinancial assets, and spending.
# We have no direct evidence, of which I am aware, on the way that such funds are used. However, we can make use of several surveys that have explored how cash-outs associated with mortgage refinancing and home equity loans are expended. Typically, these surveys indicate that households allocate so-called cash-outs--that is, the amount by which a refinanced mortgage exceeds the pre-refinanced outstanding debt--to repayment of nonmortgage debt, acquisition of financial assets, outlays for home improvement, and personal consumption expenditures in roughly equal proportions.
# Our interest, of course, is primarily on spending; extracting home equity to repay debt or to purchase financial assets merely reshuffles balance sheets and, at least immediately, does little to affect economic activity. If these survey results are taken at face value and are applied to the case in which the home changes hands--as distinct from, say, a refinancing-- the amount of personal consumption expenditures generated from realized capital gains on the sale of homes, financed through the mortgage market, represents approximately 10 to 15 cents on the dollar. 1
# Of course, in addition to realized capital gains from the turnover of existing homes, there is a considerable amount of cash that is extracted from home equity without a home sale, principally from refinancing cash-outs and from home equity loans. Both types of equity extraction have risen considerably in recent years, in line with the marked rise in unrealized capital gains on homes. Some preliminary calculations suggest that the total of equity extractions from unrealized capital gains on homes that is spent on consumer goods and services per dollar of capital gains is a fraction of the spending engendered by the gains realized through the sale of a home. 2 3 This difference occurs, to a large extent, because the net extraction of equity is much higher among homes that have turned over than among those that have not.
# While data on home mortgage debt and house turnover can be used to analyze the particular channels through which capital gains on homes spur consumer outlays, the financing linkages between stock market capital gains and consumer spending are less clear. Homeowners typically own one home, which they hold, on average, for nearly a decade. Financing is almost exclusively through the mortgage market, and equity extractions for spending, accordingly, are readily identified. Stocks, in contrast, tend to be held in portfolios that have far greater rates of turnover than homes, and financing sources are much more diverse and changeable. Moreover, although gains in defined contribution plans, IRAs, and other tax-deferred accounts almost surely affect consumer spending, the complicated tax treatment and restrictions on the use of those funds make the connections between capital gains in these accounts and spending quite indirect.
# Nonetheless, even setting aside all pension-type assets, household capital gains on directly held equities and mutual funds in recent years have been two to four times the size of overall gains on homes. The sheer size of such gains suggests that capital gains on equities have been a more potent factor in determining spending than gains on homes. In fact, if we accept a total net wealth effect on consumption of 3 to 5 cents on the dollar, and if further analysis supports the larger net spending propensities from capital gains on homes suggested by mortgage and survey data, then the propensity to spend out of each dollar of stock market gains would be less than the propensity to spend out of a dollar from gains on homes, but still larger in overall dollar magnitude.
# Of course, these quantitative magnitudes are tentative, and a great deal of additional work will be necessary to better understand and to confirm the nature and magnitudes of the relationships between capital gains on houses and stocks--realized and unrealized--and consumer spending.
# * * *
# No matter how one differentiates the effects on consumer spending of capital gains on stock market and housing wealth, it is clear that the massive increase in capital values over the past five years had a profound impact on output and income. The influence of capital gains on economic behavior also is likely to be of substantial consequence for the prospective performance of the economy.
# That influence also can be seen in our national income and product accounts (NIPA). By design, these accounts measure the market value of the output of goods and services and its distribution to the factors of production. As such, they exclude capital gains and losses. This exclusion is especially relevant for personal saving, where our accounting conventions result in capital gains having a large effect on the published figures. In part, the reason is that the NIPA deduct taxes paid on realized capital gains from personal income and treat them, in effect, as a transfer to the government sector, even though the capital gains that generated those taxes are excluded from income. 4 This issue is not trivial. As best we can determine, of the 4.6 percentage point decline in the personal saving rate between 1995 and 2000, a full percentage point is attributable to the increase in federal and state capital gains taxes paid over that period.
# Capital gains have also significantly influenced the measured personal saving rate as a result of the NIPA treatment of the pension fund sector. In particular, because defined-benefit pensions are considered part of the "personal sector," employer contributions to such plans are included in disposable income, as are the interest, dividend, and rental incomes received by these plans. In contrast, benefit payments to individuals are not part of personal income because they are considered intrasectoral transfers.
# Neither households nor corporations, however, are likely to view their own financial activities in that manner. Surely, for defined-benefit pensions, it is the benefit payments to retirees rather than the employer inflows into the pension sector that individuals perceive as personal income. For their part, businesses have often viewed defined-benefit pension plans, in effect, as business-sector profit centers because capital gains affect corporate defined-benefit pension contributions and, hence, earnings.
# This consideration is relevant in the measurement and interpretation of the personal saving rate. In recent years, contributions to private defined-benefit plans have declined significantly as an increasing part of these plans' accrued benefit liabilities have been met through a rise in the market value of their equity holdings. Offsetting this decline, to some extent, has been an increase in dividend and other capital income.
# If private and state and local defined-benefit pension plans had been separated from the personal sector, the personal saving rate would have fallen about 3/4 percentage point less from 1995 to 2000, all else being equal.
# All told, if households viewed taxes on capital gains as a subtraction from those gains and not from income and, further, if households viewed benefit payments received from defined-benefit plans as income rather than their employers' contributions (as well as the investment income of the plans), perceived disposable income in 2000 would have been higher as would the personal saving rate.
# In short, roughly two-fifths of the measured decline in the personal saving rate since 1995 reflects the foregoing NIPA income-accounting conventions.
# I should emphasize that any accounting adjustments made to personal saving because of changes in the definition of disposable income are exactly offset in business and government saving so that national saving is unaffected. The increment to personal saving associated with a treatment of the private defined-benefit pension sector as a business profit center would be offset by a decline in corporate profits and business saving. In addition, a designation of taxes on capital gains as capital transfers (in a manner similar to estate and gift taxes) would raise measured personal saving and lower overall tax receipts and, hence, government saving. 5 Thus, while total national saving would be unaffected by these specific accounting adjustments for capital gains, the distribution of NIPA saving among households, businesses, and governments would be significantly influenced.
# One must recognize that no single way to array information on income, production, and capital gains is best. The particular array employed depends on the specific purposes to which the data set is to be applied. The treatment of capital gains in the NIPA, for example, is intended to allow the accounts to most accurately attribute national saving to the various sectors in the accounts. Indeed, when that is the objective, the removal of capital gains is essential. For analysis of issues related to consumer spending, though, the NIPA personal saving rate presents an incomplete picture of the financial state of the household sector in the aggregate, and an adjustment along the lines previously suggested may be informative.
# In addition to the effect of income-accounting conventions, of course, we must consider the real economy influence of capital gains on the level of consumption. The estimates of the effect of household capital gains on consumer spending of 3 to 5 cents on the dollar suggest that, directly and indirectly, capital gains easily account for the remainder of the measured five-year decline in the saving rate.
# Obviously, this is not to say that had asset prices been flat for an extended period the personal saving rate would have been unchanged, on net, over the past five years. If asset prices had not risen, real incomes would surely have been altered, and the vast array of secondary and tertiary effects of asset-price changes would have been different. Nonetheless, this exercise fosters additional important insights into the dynamics of household behavior and the relationships among asset prices, income, and consumption.
# The complexity of these relationships underscores the potential usefulness of developing separate sets of accounts to track capital gains. These accounts could supplement the income and product accounts, the flow of funds accounts, and the balance of payments accounts. The last two currently exhibit, in part, the effect of capital gains and can be separated into special accounts. A supplementary set of detailed tables on capital gains exclusions from the national income and product accounts also would be a useful addition to our overall system of economic accounts.
# * * *
# This morning I have not endeavored to discuss the effects of capital gains, other than peripherally, on investment in plant and equipment, home improvement, tax revenues, and government surpluses, and their obvious significance in tracking international economic flows. Clearly, these also are relevant to any evaluation of macroeconomic events and warrant further study.
# * * *
# In closing, accounting systems are not ends in themselves. We construct them because they have a function in aiding our understanding of some particular aspect of a business operation at a company level or for an economy as a whole. As we endeavor to better understand how changes in the level and composition of wealth affect economic behavior, new accounting systems may be required to supplement those that have long served us so well. Technology has facilitated the production of information at a far faster rate than at any time in the past. But in the information economy, it remains up to us to organize and use that information in ways that improve the quality of decision making.'''

a_2001_20 = '''I am glad to be here today to talk about the role of infrastructure investment in economic development. As some of you may know, this is a subject that I studied before joining the Board. Ten years ago a cottage industry arose in the economics profession investigating the role of public infrastructure investment in the productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1994, I wrote an article summarizing what had been learned up to that point. I felt that the evidence then was quite unclear--the many econometric uncertainties made it very hard to attribute the productivity slowdown to a shortage of infrastructure investment.
That was then, this is now. The question has been turned on its head since1995 when productivity began a dramatic climb. Although public investment in infrastructure has picked up somewhat, the bulk of the recent increase in the nation's capital stock has come from soaring private investment. Does that mean that private infrastructure investment is sufficient? Or is there still a role for public infrastructure investment in boosting the long-run growth of the economy? And, as a corollary, what are the factors that should guide government policy as it relates to infrastructure investment? These are some of the broad issues I would like to discuss today.
As a definitional matter, infrastructure investment, or capital, consists of large capital- intensive projects, often publicly owned or regulated, that provide the backbone of the distribution system for the economy. Highways, airports, harbors, utility distribution systems, railways, water and sewer systems, and communications networks are examples of projects that would be considered infrastructure investment.
Historically, it seems clear that infrastructure investment has been crucial to the process of economic development in America. In our nation's earliest days, construction of canals and turnpikes, followed by construction of railroads in the first half of the nineteenth century, greatly increased the prospects for trade and development. Large-scale investment in electricity and telephone networks near the turn of the last century facilitated the development of a broad spectrum of innovations that, after a time, significantly improved the productivity of America's workers.
From this overall picture, it seems that infrastructure is important to growth. But how important is it empirically, and how much can changes in infrastructure investment explain changes in productivity growth? As I mentioned, these questions received a lot of attention in the economics profession about ten years ago. Back then, the burning question was whether the slowdown in productivity growth experienced in the United States after 1973 could be attributed to a decline in public infrastructure investment. In particular, the stock of highways and streets per person had leveled off after growing steadily between 1950 and 1973. A natural question was whether the decline in spending on roads caused the decline in productivity.
Figuring out exactly what forces affect productivity, and actually measuring effects, turn out to be very difficult. One particularly difficult issue is a favorite of economists--the distinction between marginal and average. According to research by John Fernald of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, public investment in highways contributed about 1 percentage point more to productivity growth before 1973 than after. The building of the interstate highway system allowed for greatly increased trade. It also made profitable continued investments and innovation in the automobile industry, and it eventually allowed for the development of efficient and effective supply-chain management techniques that have greatly enhanced productivity over the years. But Fernald's evidence also suggests that once the network of highways was in place, the productivity payoff from further road building was considerably smaller.
Today, we are faced with explaining a different phenomenon--the recent pickup in productivity growth. A key question is the extent to which the recent productivity surge can be linked to infrastructure spending. Research by Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel, two economists at the Board, indicates that to a significant degree the current productivity boom can be explained by developments in information technology. How much these improvements are associated with infrastructure spending is hard to say. Although the tremendous increase in computing speed, and the tremendous reduction in the price of computing, yielded direct benefits to users, the benefits of the computer revolution were vastly enhanced by the advent of the Internet. In a sense, the Internet can be thought of as the infrastructure of the computer revolution. Like other networks, the Internet significantly raised the productivity of each and every computer. The more Internet users there are, the more valuable each Internet connection and the more valuable the information that can be disseminated over the Internet. Thus, it seems clear that the synergies between innovations in computing and innovations in communications have yielded great benefits. And like the interstate highway system, the effects of the Internet on productivity growth are likely to wane over time-- although it seems that we have a long way to go before these particular marginal benefits taper off.
One interesting question is: How much did public infrastructure spending contribute to this latest productivity boost? Clearly, the government had much to do with the development of the Internet. In the mid- to late 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency at the Department of Defense, generally known by its acronym, ARPA, created a small network, ARPANET, to promote the computer-to-computer sharing of information among researchers in the United States. This network was the forerunner of what would eventually become the Internet.
The National Science Foundation expanded ARPANET to universities and research centers before turning it over to private providers in the mid-1990s. Without the early government subsidization of basic research on computer-to-computer communication, it is not clear that the Internet would be as advanced as it is today.
In contrast to the fully public interstate highway system, infrastructure projects often feature a mixture of public and private elements, as does the Internet. The building of the canals was sometimes financed by private investors, sometimes with public funds. The building of the railroads was financed entirely by private companies, although the federal government heavily subsidized railroads through land grants.
What about infrastructure investment in Mexico and other developing countries? The evidence from Mexico, as well as national and cross-country studies more generally, suggests that public capital formation in developing countries has had significant productivity and growth effects. Although the qualitative links are clear, there is less consensus about the exact magnitude of the effect, given that economic growth and infrastructure spending are simultaneously determined variables, and it is difficult to isolate the direction of causation. Studies have also found that whereas non-infrastructure public spending appears to crowd out private investment, public expenditures on infrastructure seem to encourage private investment.
Research also highlights a number of issues that might be especially relevant for developing countries. First, studies indicate that the public infrastructure in a number of such countries is of poor quality, and is used inefficiently. Second, it has been found that corruption can distort the entire decisionmaking process associated with government investment projects. The greater potential for bribery for this type of government spending may lead to an increased quantity of public infrastructure, but it may also partly account for its very poor quality. Finally, public infrastructure spending seems to bear a larger brunt of the fiscal retrenchment that developing economies often have to undertake in times of financial crises, raising questions about whether it's the wrong kind of spending that is cut. In light of these considerations, it is important to focus on government's role in investing, regulating, and maintaining a country's infrastructure--and the appropriate mix of public and private investment--in order to reap the full benefits of the public capital. That leads to my second question, which is probably the more interesting one: What factors determine appropriate government policy regarding infrastructure investment, and how do those factors play out in today's new economy? As mentioned earlier, government itself can provide infrastructure as it did in the case of the interstate highway system. Government can also influence private infrastructure investment--by direct subsidies, by regulation of prices, or by regulation of the rules of conduct in an industry.
The public policy issues revolve around the fact that infrastructure investment has large fixed costs relative to marginal costs, a phenomenon known as increasing returns to scale. When the fixed costs become so large that only one firm can feasibly operate, we call this a natural monopoly. Because of well-known pricing problems associated with monopolies, governments can step in and directly provide the infrastructure itself or can regulate the private providers.
Take the example of roadways. Construction of streets and highways involves huge fixed costs, and as long as the roadways are not congested, the incremental cost of having an additional car on the road is minimal. Collecting revenues from users may be costly, particularly in the case of city streets, so government has traditionally provided construction services, paying for them largely through taxation.
A similar case involves local telephone service. It is generally inefficient to have more than one set of telephone wires installed along every street. But having only one firm with a wire down a street would give that firm too much market power, risking excessive prices. Consequently, local telephone service is typically a private, but regulated, industry.
Having noted instances in which government involvement may be appropriate, it is easy to overstate the value of government intervention. There are many instances in which government regulation, rather than improving efficiency and lowering prices, has actually had the opposite effect. Regulated industries can become entrenched monopolies and can waste valuable resources maintaining their monopoly power. Innovation can be suppressed, and without competition, the quality of services can suffer. The experience of deregulation has shown that competition can survive even in industries that exhibit some of the characteristics of natural monopolies. And competition unleashes entrepreneurial forces, leading to such innovations as the hub-and-spoke system following deregulation of the airline industry, the wide variety of new telephones and fax equipment arising out of telecommunications deregulation, and financial innovations to reduce risk after deregulation of the natural gas industry.
The economics of information technology are not dissimilar to the economics of older infrastructure industries. The large economies of scale in creating information--once information is created, it can be distributed virtually without cost--and the existence of positive network externalities--the larger a network, the more valuable it is--mean that the competitive process can easily lead to a fairly concentrated industry. But experience to date suggests that competition in information technology can be fierce, despite the industry's cost structure. For example, many firms are competing to provide telecommunications services. While the existence of multiple sets of fiber optic cables linking cities may not be efficient in and of itself, the benefits of added price competition may outweigh the costs of physical inefficiency.
One way to preserve competition and promote efficiency in the high-tech industry is through the setting of standards. In the network economy, having common standards increases the value of innovation, as more users can easily avail themselves of the new technology, and actually allows more firms to survive and compete. What the government's role needs to be in setting standards is an open question. While they could get together to determine standards, and often do, firms are naturally wary of being subject to anti-trust regulation. There is often a fine line between setting standards that promote competition and setting standards that provide an advantage for incumbent firms. Thus, government might have a role in setting or enforcing standards. On the other hand, having the government preempt the battle over the best technology by choosing standards may squelch innovation. A limited role for government may be best--but even then, it may be hard to define precisely that role.
The lesson to be learned by the United States, by Mexico, and indeed by all countries, is that the role of government in infrastructure investment may be more subtle than one might have thought. There may still be some industries in which government should actually invest physical capital. Government certainly should ensure that the existing public infrastructure is properly managed and maintained. But, in general, government's role should be to make industries as competitive as possible. In some cases, regulation of actual prices may be unavoidable; but in many cases, even if government needs to regulate, the regulation can be less intrusive, so as to maintain competition. The entrepreneurial forces unleashed by competitive markets can spur productivity growth much faster than direct measures taken by government.'''

a_2001_21 = '''I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Charlotte Economics Club. Occasions such as this provide those of us who work on economic policy in Washington an invaluable way to touch base and exchange ideas with business leaders around the country. The views that I will set forth today are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.
As you know, economic growth has been slow for four quarters after several years of very strong gains. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this slowdown has been the abrupt deceleration in business fixed investment. Business investment in equipment and software grew exceptionally rapidly in the latter half of the 1990s and the first half of 2000, but it moved down in the final quarter of last year and declined further in the first quarter of 2001. Indicators of second-quarter investment outlays have been decidedly downbeat.
More dramatic still is the turnabout in a number of high-tech investment categories. Real business outlays on information-processing equipment dropped at an annual rate of almost 10 percent in the first quarter of this year after having posted increases that averaged close to 25 percent a year from 1997 through 2000. Within that category, real investment in computers and related equipment showed no growth in the first quarter of this year after having risen 30 percent or more in each of the seven years starting in 1994. Outlays for communications equipment swung from growth rates of about 25 percent in 1999 and 2000 to an annual rate of decline of more than 30 percent in the first quarter of this year. The cutback in business spending on high-tech equipment has led, in turn, to sharp cutbacks in output at the firms that produce such equipment. Many of these firms have experienced sharp declines in actual and anticipated profits, and the values of their equities have dropped.
Business fixed investment has always been cyclical, of course. When the economy is speeding up, businesses typically respond by boosting their expansion plans, and the resulting increment to the desired capital stock leads to a burst of investment spending. Similarly, when the economy slows, plans for capital expansion are shaded down, and investment is scaled down or perhaps even postponed for a time. Because the stock of capital is large relative to the investment spending in any particular year, a relatively small shift in expansion plans generates a big swing in current expenditures. This is the accelerator effect that is commonly discussed in economics textbooks.
However, some observers believe that what has been happening recently to business fixed investment differs in some important respects, or at least in degree, from the normal accelerator response to a slowdown in aggregate demand. These observers hypothesize that, for a variety of reasons, including the more subdued prospects for aggregate demand going forward, firms may be holding considerably more capital now than they would prefer. Reflecting this possibility is the opinion we hear that there is currently an "overhang" of capital in the economy. According to this view, too much was put in place too soon, and as a corollary, investment spending will need to remain subdued for a long enough time in the future to let the actual capital stock come back into line with the desired capital stock.
In the remainder of my talk today, I wish to explore more fully this question of a capital stock overhang. Along the way, I will be laying out some analytical distinctions that are important to understanding exactly what we mean when we talk about an overhang of capital. At the same time, I will try to demonstrate why a capital overhang is so difficult to identify and estimate in practice. I plan to give some special attention to those high-tech industries in which the turnabout in investment spending has been the most dramatic this past year, notably telecommunications industries. Finally, I will have some brief comments about the implications of a capital overhang for the economy and for monetary policy.
Measuring the Capital Goods Overhang
Capital, by definition, has value because it is expected to generate income in the future. In view of that orientation toward the future, the value placed on capital can shift considerably as expectations change. Some of the same firms that might have felt comfortable with their capital stocks a year ago, or even been of the view that more capital was needed, may now view their capital as being excessive in light of the abrupt slowing in demand for their products, especially if they extrapolate the slowdown well into the future. Moreover, values that are placed on particular pieces of capital can change sharply as advances in technology make one form of equipment obsolete while creating an incentive for the rapid expansion of the stock of another form of equipment.
It might seem that business executives are the people best positioned to know if capital is indeed excessive at the moment. However, as is often the case, reports from individual firms cover a wide range of situations. Reports from high-tech companies at present are notable for the frequency with which talk of excess capital appears, and we hear reports of overhangs in some other industries as well. Many firms, particularly in the high-tech sector, have been surprised by the slump in demand or by the entry of competitors or the introduction of new products. In many of these instances, capital spending plans have been shelved or delayed. But the anecdotal evidence does not all point in one direction. A recent survey from the National Association for Business Economics showed that, at least among the companies that belong to that organization, the number of firms that perceive that they are still under-invested in high-tech equipment exceeds the number that have over-invested by a considerable margin. How those numbers translate into dollars is uncertain, of course, but the survey does remind us that we have to be cautious about the lessons we draw from the anecdotes.
We also have to be a little cautious about the inferences we draw from the recent sluggishness in investment. In particular, a downturn in investment does not, by itself, imply that firms view their capital stocks as being too large. The rate of change in the stock of capital reflects both the spending on new capital--that is, gross investment--and the rate at which capital is being consumed, mainly through depreciation. Even at rates well below those of a year ago, today's investment still likely exceeds by a significant margin the pace at which capital is depreciating. Thus, the stock of capital, at least for the economy as a whole, probably is still expanding at a brisk pace. We can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that the investment cutback of recent quarters demonstrates that businesses did not want to continue adding to their capital stocks at quite the pace that they were a while back. But whether the stock itself is too large is a different question and one to which the answer is less clear. And because the composition of the capital stock is so enormously varied, the answer will no doubt be that some forms are held greatly in excess of desired levels, some well below desired levels, and others approximately at the desired levels.
Alternatively, one might turn to econometric modeling to estimate the magnitude of such an overhang. The economics profession provides us with the logic for determining whether the stock of capital is excessive, namely the difference between the desired, or target, capital stock and the actual stock. However, empirical models are conditioned on a number of assumptions, not only about the longer-run prospects for economic growth but also about the ways in which capital and labor interact in the productive process. Such calculations require that desired and target stocks be valued for widely heterogeneous types of plant and equipment, of differing vintages and in differing states of operating efficiency. The size of the overhang can be estimated following these methods, but the results are bounded by wide ranges of uncertainty.
The financial markets have perhaps provided some of the strongest signals that the capital stock might have started growing too fast in recent years and that it might be excessive in some sectors. For example, the performance of the stock market has mirrored, in a rough way, what has happened to business fixed investment. The stock market boom of the late 1990s was associated with a growing optimism on the part of both firms and investors about future profit growth. Between 1992 and the peak in 2000, expected long-term earnings growth rates for technology firms in the S&P 500 increased from 12 percent at an annual rate to more than 22 percent . Similarly, expectations of long-term earnings growth for telecom service providers--widely anticipated to be beneficiaries of surging demand for Internet-related services--rose from 8 percent to 15 percent.
Since early- to mid-2000, however, these supportive financial conditions have eroded amid concerns that Internet retailers and other "dot-coms" face severe challenges in achieving profitability. Technology and telecommunications stock price indexes began to slump in the spring of 2000, and financing conditions for start-ups cooled off. In addition, earnings-growth projections for telecom service providers began to decline around the middle of last year, as intense competition in long-distance telephony eroded profit margins for existing business lines, and the expansion in demand for advanced products such as digital subscriber lines (DSL) was less robust than had been hoped. With a retrenchment in capital spending under way, the drop in expectations for long-term growth began to extend to manufacturers of telecom equipment and other high-tech gear during the last few months of 2000, and conditions for many such firms have remained difficult in 2001.
Will the Overhang Be Worked Off Quickly?
The obvious question is: When will the stock adjustment in high-tech capital run its course, and the supply and demand for capital goods return to balance? This question is not answerable with certainty. There are reasons to be hopeful and reasons to be cautious.
Just as firms might tend to overestimate their longer-term capital requirements when times are good, there likely is some tendency to underestimate longer-term needs when the economy is soft. Thus, it could well be that stocks of capital will not seem so excessive once the economy picks up. Moreover, as a number of observers have suggested, the fact that a capital stock overhang might be concentrated most heavily in the high-tech industries has one important silver lining. This advantage is that, on average, a good deal of high-tech equipment probably depreciates more rapidly than most other types of equipment. Consequently, with other things equal, the shorter life of some of the capital currently held in excess amounts would seem to imply that the overhang can be worked off more quickly than otherwise. There is much to be said for this point of view, and undoubtedly the adjustment process may progress more quickly than if the overhang were concentrated in other types of equipment or structures.
Nonetheless, in the interest of exploring more fully the potential dynamics of high-tech capital investment, I would like to take a few minutes to examine why an overhang might take longer to work off than we might like or expect. And I have to emphasize here that I am focusing on some parts of the high-tech sector, not the sector as a whole, and certainly not the economy as a whole.
One reason an overhang could persist is that some types of high-tech capital do not depreciate rapidly. For instance, unlike the equipment that sends signals down the optical fiber, the fiber itself probably has a useful lifetime that is reasonably long. Optical fiber today is not greatly different in quality from the fiber of a few years ago, and there is little physical deterioration once the fiber is in the ground. All this suggests that the excess capacity of total fiber could take quite some time to work off. And presumably other types of equipment and structures are similar in this respect to fiber.
Second, depreciation rates are partly a reflection of economic obsolescence; that is, capital often loses value because of the expectation that it will soon be replaced by newer, more advanced equipment. However, the replacement decision is, to some degree, at the discretion of the firm that owns the capital. In the context of weaker-than-expected demand for their products, and hence weaker cash flow, businesses may decide that they prefer to hang onto their existing computer hardware, software, and communications equipment for longer than they otherwise might. Accordingly, it might presently be the case that high-tech equipment is not as short-lived as we think it usually is. Adding further to firms' willingness to hold on to their existing equipment through the current period is the apparent absence of new "killer apps," break-through technological advances in applications such as e-mail and web browsers that in the past have spurred investment in software and in complementary goods like computers and communications equipment.
A third reason for caution in assuming that the overhang will be worked off quickly is that even if high-tech depreciation rates remain elevated, new investment could continue feeding into the capital stock because of planning lags, lengthy building times, or costly irreversibilities. For example, a national optical network can take years to roll out--longer than the average time to build a nonresidential structure. If demand falls below expectations, a firm might decide to persevere to completion of an investment project with a lengthy building time, but may be left with a capital good that is ill-suited to the conditions that prevail at the time of completion.
Lastly, the situation of the high-tech industries is also complicated by some considerations that are difficult to capture in the normal calculations of investment and depreciation. One such factor is the changing market structure of the high-tech sector. In the mid-1990s, deregulation in the telecom industry and the rise of the Internet led to a surge of entrants into the high-tech areas. These startups not only generated a good deal of spending on capital goods themselves, they also forced incumbent firms to invest and innovate to keep up, even as profits were eroding. Survivor mentalities may have caused the competing firms to push capital outlays further than they might have otherwise, on the notion that the short-term losses recorded in stretching to expand market share could be made up later as competitors fell by the wayside.
The creation of the long-haul fiber optic network, the part of the network that runs from city to city, provides perhaps the best illustration of the excesses that can develop as firms rush to establish their market positions. The creation of these networks may also indicate the complexities involved in determining the size of a capital overhang in a particular industry. In 1995, just three firms had significant long-haul fiber optic networks in the United States. By 2000, however, there were nine such firms, and by the end of this year, there will be several more. In some regions of the country, the numbers are larger still, with some major cities in the Midwest being served by as many as twenty long-haul firms.
The competing long-haul firms have laid huge amounts of fiber over the past few years. Not only do numerous firms compete, but each firm also has the incentive to put in place more fiber than it might need in the immediate future. As I mentioned before, the optical fiber itself is long-lasting, and the quality of new fiber has tended to increase only slowly over time. Thus, with the risk of obsolescence low, investment could be targeted more toward anticipated long-run needs. Moreover, fiber itself is relatively cheap. By contrast, the vastly greater expense in building a network is the construction cost associated with laying the fiber. Indeed, back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the cost per mile of fiber is something like $170, whereas the cost of installation is more on the order of $125,000 per mile. In that context, it is not surprising that firms would lay excess amounts of fiber in a given trench once the ground is broken.
In contrast to the fiber itself, the equipment that is used to transmit and receive data over the network has been subject to very rapid technological change, and the economic considerations of investing in this type of equipment are similar to those for computers and other types of capital goods that rapidly become obsolete because of the fast pace of technological change. Although some overhangs of the transmitting and receiving equipment may be present, the stock of such equipment has likely been tied more closely to current and near-term demand than is the case for fiber. Accordingly, the extent of overcapacity for this equipment is likely to be less severe. Moreover, two forces should operate in the direction of resolving any overhang in relatively speedy fashion--namely, that the equipment depreciates rapidly, and also that the amount of information being transmitted over the Internet is still growing very rapidly, roughly doubling each year since the start of the 1990s.
Meanwhile, there is a shortage of what is sometimes referred to as "last mile" capacity, the component of the network that runs from a long-haul node in a particular geographic area to individual businesses and homes. In view of that shortage and of the excess amount of long-haul fiber, patterns of investment are shifting. Industry analysts expect that in 2001 more fiber will be laid by cable companies and short-haul providers than by long-haul providers, and this gap is likely to widen in coming years. Thus, even in the hard-pressed telecommunications industry, we are probably going to see continued rapid expansion in some types of capital, even as overhangs of capital may persist in other areas.
Macroeconomic Implications
For the economy as a whole, it seems likely that the overall stock of high-tech capital will grow rapidly over time, even if installation of some types of high-tech equipment and structures may be slowing down. The economic benefits of making such investments still appear to be quite persuasive in many cases. There is no evidence of an end to the growth in the amount of information that can be put on a computer chip. Computers coming on the market are getting more powerful year by year, and their prices still are falling quite rapidly. The pressures on firms to remain competitive should keep them from putting off investments in new, lower-cost products for very long. All in all, I am hopeful that we will look back on the present concerns about excess stocks of capital as only a temporary interlude in the ongoing transformation of the economy toward more and more advanced technologies.
In terms of macroeconomic performance, the increase in the high-tech capital stock is important because of the boost it has given to the growth of structural productivity over the past few years. Productivity growth has benefited not only from an increase in the amount of capital per worker, especially of high-tech capital, but also from the enhanced efficiencies that have been made possible in combining labor and capital in the workplace. I realize, of course, that measured productivity growth has not been all that impressive in recent quarters. That weakness, however, almost surely is a reflection of the sluggishness of the economy, rather than a sign that structural productivity might be reverting to the slow rate of growth that was evident before the mid-1990s. I continue to be cautiously optimistic that the prospects for healthy gains in productivity over the longer term still are quite favorable.
In light of the overhang in some types of capital, some have wondered whether monetary policy might be less effective in combating the current economic weakness than otherwise. After all, conditions in short-term money markets, by themselves, are unlikely to induce substantial further investment, for example, in the long-haul fiber network. However, it would be a mistake to focus on only one channel of monetary influence, such as the impact that policy might have on the demand for high-tech equipment. Monetary policy works on a wide variety of spending, including housing, consumption expenditures, and net exports, and the channels through which policy works range broadly across the financial markets. Just as in the past, an easing of policy is likely, over time, to provide impetus to growth of demand in the aggregate, even if it does not immediately lift the prospects of the hard-pressed firms in some high-tech industries.
Nonetheless, despite our aggressive easing actions of the first half of this year, I believe that it is too early to say definitively that the current period of subpar growth has ended. Given the likely magnitude of the capital goods adjustment that I have just discussed, as well as other forces, I expect only a gradual pick-up in the rate of growth later this year. Against that background, I continue to believe that the balance of risks seems to be toward continuing weakness in the economy.
Conclusion
In sum, although it is difficult to determine how large the overhangs of capital might be at present, they seem likely to exert at least a modest amount of drag on the economy over the near term, even as growth picks up. Over time, though, the discrepancy between actual and desired stocks of capital will be worked off, both as actual holdings diminish through depreciation, and as target holdings increase with the revival of aggregate demand. The overhang does not require that we alter our basic approach to monetary policy: We still maintain the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. Mainly, the overhang factors into our thinking through the risk it might pose to the intermediate-term outlook for economic activity and employment. Over the long term, the current problems almost surely will be resolved in the ways that markets have solved past problems of capital misallocation: Investments that no longer seem likely to earn the profits that had been expected will be written off, at the same time that capital is being reallocated toward emerging opportunities. Overall, I remain cautiously optimistic about the long-run prospects for investment in new technologies, and for the beneficial implications that will have for the U.S. and world economies.'''

a_1998_17 = '''I am pleased once again to open this annual symposium. At the outset, I wish to thank Tom Hoenig and his staff for assembling a highly capable group of experts to inform us and to stimulate discussion on an important issue in the world economy. The study of income inequality--its causes, its consequences, and its potential policy implications--has a long history in economics, although it has not always had a high profile among researchers and policymakers. To borrow a phrase from Professor Atkinson, income distribution in recent years has been "brought in from the cold." In part, that awareness has resulted from the experience of many industrialized economies with widening earnings inequality in the 1980s and 1990s. It has been heightened by interest in the consequences of economic change in developing, newly industrialized, and transition economies.
The experience of industrialized countries, including the United States, with growing income inequality has spawned a great deal of research on the functioning of labor markets, on the sources of shifts in the demand for various types of skills, on the supply responses of workers, and on the efficacy of government efforts to intervene in the operation of labor markets. A number of those who have contributed importantly to this work will be participating in this conference. One story that has emerged from that body of research is now familiar: Rising demand for those workers who have the skills to effectively harness new technologies has been outpacing supply, and, thus, the compensation of those workers has been increasing more rapidly than for the lesser skilled segment of the workforce. That this supply-demand gap has been an important source of widening earnings inequality is now widely accepted within the economics profession. However, the considerable diversity of experiences across countries as well as the finding that earnings inequality has also increased within groups of workers with similar measured skills and experience suggest that we may need to look deeper than skill-biased technological change if we are to fully understand widening wage dispersion. In particular, how have private and public institutions influenced inequality over the past two decades? What roles have been played by growing international trade and the evolving ways in which production is organized? Again, the participants in this symposium are well-equipped to speak to these issues, and we should learn much more about the causes of widening inequality during the next two days.
In discussing the extent to which large portions of the population are not reaping the benefits of economic growth, I hope that the participants at this conference will not stop with an analysis of trends in earnings--or, for that matter, even trends in income more broadly defined. Ultimately, we are interested in the question of relative standards of living and economic well-being. Thus, we need also to examine trends in the distribution of wealth, which, more fundamentally than earnings or income, represents a measure of the ability of households to consume. And we will even want to consider the distribution of consumption, which likely has the advantage of smoothing through transitory shocks affecting particular individuals or households for just a year or two.
Among these more comprehensive measures, data for the United States from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances suggest that inequality in household wealth--that is, in net worth--was somewhat higher in 1989 than at the time of our earlier survey in 1963. Subsequently, the 1992 and 1995 surveys--and here our data are statistically more comparable from survey to survey than they were earlier--showed that wealth inequality remained little changed in terms of the broad measures.1 Nonetheless, that stability masks considerable churning among the subgroups. One particularly notable change was an apparent rise in the share of wealth held by the wealthiest families at the expense of other wealthy families; most of the change occurred within the top 10 percent of the distribution.
Moreover, our research using the survey suggests that conclusions about the distribution of wealth are sensitive--although to a lesser degree than income--to the state of the economy and to institutional arrangements for saving. For instance, among the wealthiest ½ percent of households, business assets, which tend to be quite cyclical, are particularly important. At the other end of the distribution, owned principal residences, the values of which are not as sensitive to business cycle conditions, are a typical household's most important asset. Another interesting finding is that if we expand the definition of wealth to include estimates of Social Security and pension wealth, the distribution among U.S. households becomes much more even.2 This finding suggests that, in addition to factors influencing private wealth accumulation, the evolution of institutional arrangements for saving that has taken place over the last two decades may have played an important role in affecting changes in the distribution of wealth over time.
What about the effect of the recent rise in stock and bond market values? The typical view is that the growth in mutual funds and other financial investment avenues has allowed individuals further down in the wealth distribution to take advantage of the strength in equity markets. Certainly, our figures show that households lower in the income distribution are now more likely to own stocks than a decade ago.3 However, between the 1992 and 1995 surveys, the spread of stock ownership and the rise in prices did not lead to a rise in the share of stock and mutual fund assets owned by the bottom 90 percent of the wealth distribution. Although their dollar holdings rose rapidly, the increases were not as large as those for households at the top of the wealth distribution. If patterns of equity ownership have not changed much since 1995, the steep rise in stock prices over the past several years would suggest a further increase in the concentration of net worth. This influence could be offset, to some extent, by a continued broadening in the ownership of equities, particularly through tax-deferred savings accounts. Moreover, some additional offset may have occurred through rising house prices, an important asset of middle class families. Our 1998 survey, which is now in the field, will yield a clearer reading both on how wealth concentration has changed and on the relative importance of different assets in that change.
Despite our best efforts to measure trends in income and wealth, I believe that even those measures--by themselves--cannot yield a complete answer to the question of trends in material or economic well-being. In the United States, we observe a noticeable difference between trends in the dispersion of holdings of claims to goods and services--that is, income and wealth--and trends in the dispersion of actual consumption, the bottom-line determinant of material well-being. Ultimately, we are interested in whether households have the means to meet their needs for goods and for services, including those such as education and medical care, that build and maintain human capital.
Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey that the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts, researchers have found that inequality in consumption, when measured by current outlays, is less than inequality in income.4 These findings are not surprising. As is well known, consumers tend to maintain their levels of consumption in the face of temporary fluctuations in income. Variations in asset holdings and debt typically act as buffers to changes in income. Thus, consumption patterns tend to look more like patterns in income that have been averaged over several years--a finding that should remind us of the pitfalls of reading too much into any year-to-year change in our measures of economic well-being.
The BLS's consumer expenditure data suggest a rise in inequality over the 1980s comparable to that shown by the Census family income figures. However, during the first half of the 1990s, inequality partially receded for consumer expenditures while for income it continued to rise (table 1). The consumption data used in these calculations include only what individuals purchase directly out of their incomes and accumulated savings. Recently, researchers have extended the analysis using a more complete and more theoretically appealing measure of consumption that includes the indirect flow of services from the stock of durable goods that they already own--houses, vehicles, and major appliances.5 As one might expect, although this measure of consumption has a profile somewhat similar to that seen in the current expenditure data over the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, it shows still lower levels of inequality overall and a clearer pattern of consumption smoothing during the 1981-83 recession.
The information available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey can be used to calculate another interesting measure of the well-being of households: changes in inequality in the ownership of consumer durables. The BLS staff has updated tabulations of these data that they prepared for me several years ago (table 2). Of course, ownership rates for household durables clearly rise with income. But for a number of goods--for example, dishwashers, clothes dryers, microwaves, and motor vehicles--the distribution of ownership rates by income decile has become more equal over time.
Even though we may be able to develop an array of measures of current and past trends in inequality--such as those that I have described and potentially others that may be presented at this symposium--we will likely still face considerable uncertainty about how to interpret those measures and about what the future may hold for the trend and the distribution of economic well-being.
Wealth has always been created, virtually by definition, when individuals use their growing knowledge, in conjunction with an expanding capital stock, to produce goods and services of value. The process of wealth creation in the United States has evolved in a number of important ways. Over the last century, we have learned how to be more efficient in meeting the needs of consumers, and thus we have moved from producing essentials to the production of more discretionary goods and services. Moreover, these goods and services have been, over time, increasingly less constrained by the limits of physical bulk. More recently, we have found ways to unbundle the particular characteristics of each good and service to maximize its value to each individual. That striving to expand the options for satisfying the particular needs of individuals has resulted in a shift toward value created through the exploitation of ideas and concepts and away from the more straightforward utilization of physical resources and manual labor. The new thrust has led to structural changes in the way that we organize the production and the distribution of goods and services. It has increased the demand for, and the compensation of, workers who have the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and to interact effectively with others. Most important, it has accorded particularly high value to the application of advanced computer and telecommunications technologies to the generation of economic wealth.
At the same time, however, the consequences of technological advances and their implications for the creation of wealth have become increasingly unpredictable. We have found that we cannot forecast with any precision which particular technology or synergies of technologies will add significantly to our knowledge and to our ability to gain from that knowledge. Even if future technological change were to occur at a steady rate, variations in our capacity to absorb and apply advances would likely lead to an uneven rate of increase--over time and across individuals--in returns to expanded investment in knowledge: Supplies of appropriately skilled workers can vary. In some cases, the initial choices in the exploitation of advances may turn out to be sub-optimal. In other cases, the full potential of advances may be realized only after extensive improvements or after complementary innovations in other fields of science.
As we consider the causes and consequences of inequality, we should also be mindful that, over time, the relationship of economic growth, increases in standards of living, and the distribution of wealth has evolved differently in various political and institutional settings. Thus, generalizations about the past and the future may be hard to make, particularly in the current dynamic and uncertain environment of economic change. We need to ask, for example, whether we should be concerned with the degree of income inequality if all groups are experiencing relatively rapid gains in their real incomes, though those rates of gain may differ. And, we cannot ignore what is happening to the level of average income while looking at trends in the distribution. In this regard, our goal as central bankers should be clear: We must pursue monetary conditions in which stable prices contribute to maximizing sustainable long-run growth. Such disciplined policies will offer the best underpinnings for identifying opportunities to channel growing knowledge, innovation, and capital investment into the creation of wealth that, in turn, will lift living standards as broadly as possible. Moreover, as evidenced by this symposium, sustaining a healthy economy and a stable financial system naturally permits us to take the time to focus efforts on addressing the distributional issues facing our society and on other challenging issues that may remain out in the cold.'''
